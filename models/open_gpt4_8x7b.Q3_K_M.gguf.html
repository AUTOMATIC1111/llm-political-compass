    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. I believe that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity, as it is a tool that can be used to improve the lives of people all over the world. Trans-national corporations have a role to play in this process, but their interests should not be the primary focus. Instead, the goal should be to create a global economic system that is fair, equitable, and sustainable for all people, regardless of where they live or what their economic status may be. This requires a strong commitment to ethical business practices, responsible corporate citizenship, and a willingness to work collaboratively with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to address the challenges and opportunities of globalization. Ultimately, the success of economic globalization will be measured not by the profits of corporations, but by the well-being of the people it is intended to serve.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement &quot;I&#x27;d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.&quot; I believe that it is important to be a patriot and to love and support one&#x27;s country, but it is also crucial to hold it accountable for its actions. If a country is wrong, it is the duty of its citizens to speak out and work towards change, rather than blindly supporting it. This is the only way to ensure that a country remains on the path of righteousness and progress.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. While it is true that no one chooses their country of birth, it is not foolish to be proud of it. One&#x27;s country of birth can shape their identity, culture, and values, and it is natural to feel a sense of pride and belonging towards it.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

I do not agree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; This is because the statement is too simplistic and does not take into account the complexities of relationships and alliances. Just because someone is an enemy of my enemy, it does not necessarily mean that they are my friend or that I should align myself with them. There may be other factors at play, such as their own motivations and intentions, that would make such an alliance unwise or even dangerous. It is important to carefully consider all aspects of a situation before making decisions about alliances and friendships.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

I do not agree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law is established to maintain peace and order in the world, and to ensure that countries act in a responsible and ethical manner. Military action that defies international law can lead to chaos, destruction, and loss of life, and it can also create mistrust and animosity between nations. It is important for countries to respect and adhere to international law, and to seek diplomatic solutions to conflicts whenever possible. Military action should only be used as a last resort, and it should always be in accordance with international law.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

I agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. This is because in today&#x27;s world, the line between news and entertainment has become increasingly blurred. With the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, there is a constant demand for new and exciting content. This has led to a situation where news outlets are often prioritizing sensationalism and entertainment value over accuracy and objectivity.

Furthermore, the use of clickbait headlines and misleading information has become common practice, making it difficult for people to distinguish between fact and fiction. This not only undermines the credibility of news organizations, but it also has the potential to mislead and manipulate the public.

In conclusion, I believe that the fusion of information and entertainment is a worrying trend that needs to be addressed. It is essential that news organizations prioritize accuracy and</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class, or socioeconomic status, can have a significant impact on a person&#x27;s opportunities, experiences, and worldview. People from different classes may have vastly different experiences and perspectives, even if they are from the same country. On the other hand, people from the same class may have more in common with each other, regardless of their nationality. This is not to say that nationality is not important, but rather that class can often be a more significant dividing factor.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

I disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. While both are important for a healthy economy, they have different impacts on people&#x27;s lives. Inflation can erode purchasing power and make it harder for people to afford basic necessities, but high unemployment can lead to poverty, social unrest, and a host of other problems. In my view, both inflation and unemployment need to be addressed in a balanced way, taking into account the trade-offs and potential consequences of different policy choices.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because corporations, like any other entity, are driven by their own interests. While some corporations may voluntarily take steps to protect the environment, others may not. In the absence of regulation, corporations may prioritize profits over environmental protection, leading to negative impacts on the environment. Regulation can help ensure that corporations take necessary steps to minimize their environmental impact, even if it may not be in their immediate financial interest. However, it is also important to note that regulation should be balanced with the need to maintain a competitive business environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

I do not agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; because it is a fundamentally flawed concept. This statement implies that individuals are not responsible for their own well-being, and that the state or society should be responsible for providing for their needs. This is a dangerous idea because it undermines personal responsibility and individual initiative. It also ignores the fact that people have different abilities and needs, and that it is not fair to expect everyone to contribute the same amount. Additionally, this concept can lead to a lack of incentive for people to work hard and be productive, as they may feel that their efforts will not be rewarded. Overall, I believe that individuals should be responsible for their own well-being, and that the state or society should only provide assistance when it is truly necessary.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree.

I agree with the statement that the freer the market, the freer the people. This is because a free market allows for competition, which can lead to lower prices, better quality products, and more choices for consumers. Additionally, a free market can lead to economic growth and job creation, which can increase people&#x27;s standard of living and give them more opportunities to pursue their goals and dreams. However, it is important to note that a completely unregulated market can also lead to negative consequences, such as monopolies, exploitation of workers, and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is important for governments to strike a balance between protecting the rights of individuals and allowing for the benefits of a free market to be realized.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because it is indeed a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product. This is a clear indication of the commercialization of a basic human need, which should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. The fact that people are willing to pay for something that is freely available in nature, just because it is packaged and marketed in a certain way, is a reflection of the influence that marketing and consumerism have on our society. This not only contributes to the growing problem of plastic waste, but also exacerbates social and economic inequalities. It is important to remember that access to clean drinking water is a fundamental human right, and should not be treated as a luxury or a commodity.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. I believe that land should not be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold because it is a fundamental resource that is essential for life and survival. It is the foundation for food production, water conservation, and biodiversity, and it should be protected and managed in a sustainable way for the benefit of all, rather than being subject to market forces and speculation. Additionally, the commodification of land can lead to unequal access and ownership, perpetuating social and economic inequalities.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

I strongly agree with the statement because it is often true that people who manipulate money for their own personal gain do not contribute to society in a meaningful way. These individuals often engage in activities such as speculation, which can lead to economic instability, or they may exploit loopholes in the tax system to avoid paying their fair share. While they may accumulate significant wealth, they do not necessarily create value or improve the lives of others. In fact, their actions can sometimes have the opposite effect, causing harm to individuals, communities, and the broader economy. Therefore, it is regrettable when personal fortunes are made in this way, as they are not earned through honest work or meaningful contributions to society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. This is because there are times when a country&#x27;s domestic industries may need to be shielded from foreign competition in order to allow them to grow and become more competitive. This can be especially important in industries that are critical to the country&#x27;s economy or national security. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used sparingly and carefully, as it can also have negative consequences, such as higher prices for consumers and reduced economic efficiency.</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While it is true that a company&#x27;s primary goal is to generate profits, it is also important for companies to consider their impact on society and the environment. Companies have a responsibility to their employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. This includes ensuring fair labor practices, providing safe and healthy workplaces, and minimizing their environmental footprint. By taking these social responsibilities into account, companies can build stronger relationships with their stakeholders, improve their reputation, and ultimately, contribute to a more sustainable and equitable society.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I do not agree that the rich are too highly taxed. The tax code in the United States is designed to be progressive, meaning that those who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. However, there are still many ways in which the wealthy can take advantage of tax loopholes and deductions to lower their overall tax burden. Additionally, the argument that the rich are overtaxed often ignores the fact that they also benefit from a wide range of public goods and services, such as infrastructure, education, and public safety, that are funded by taxes. Therefore, I believe that the current tax system is fair and that the rich are not overtaxed.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

I agree with the statement because I believe that those who can afford to pay for higher standards of medical care should have access to it. This is because they are the ones who can shoulder the costs of advanced medical treatments and procedures, and they are the ones who can afford to pay for the expertise of top-notch medical professionals. This, in turn, can help ensure that they receive the best possible care, which can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life.

However, it is also important to note that access to medical care should not be solely based on one&#x27;s ability to pay. Everyone, regardless of their financial situation, should have access to basic medical care, and there should be measures in place to ensure that those who cannot afford to pay for higher standards of medical care are not left behind. This can include things like government-funded healthcare programs, subsidies, and other forms of financial assistance.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

I strongly agree with the statement that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because businesses have a responsibility to be honest and transparent with their customers, and misleading them can cause harm. When businesses are dishonest, it can lead to customers making uninformed decisions, which can have negative consequences for them. Additionally, misleading the public can also harm the reputation of a business, making it less likely for customers to trust them in the future. By penalising businesses that mislead the public, governments can help to ensure that businesses are held accountable for their actions and that customers are protected from dishonest practices.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Explanation:
A free market is defined as a system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and by competition among the sellers. In this context, a genuine free market should be characterized by a high level of competition, which in turn ensures that prices are fair and that there is a wide variety of goods and services available to consumers.

However, in practice, this is not always the case. Predatory multinationals, which are large corporations that use their market power to dominate and control a particular market, can create monopolies and stifle competition. This can lead to higher prices, less choice, and a lack of innovation.

Therefore, it is necessary to have some restrictions on the ability of these multinationals to create monopolies in order to maintain a genuine free market. This can be achieved through measures such as antitrust laws, which are designed to prevent companies from</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I do not believe that abortion should always be illegal, even when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. I believe that a woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body, and that includes the decision to have an abortion. However, I also believe that there should be restrictions on late-term abortions and that there should be resources available to help women who choose to carry their pregnancies to term. Ultimately, the decision to have an abortion is a complex and deeply personal one, and it should be up to the individual woman, in consultation with her healthcare provider, to make the best decision for herself and her family.</div>

Additionally, questioning authority can lead to new ideas and perspectives, and can help to prevent the abuse of power. However, it is important to do so in a respectful and constructive manner, and to be open to the possibility that the authority in question may have valid reasons for their decisions.</div>

This is because taxpayer money should be used for essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. While the arts are important, they should not be subsidized by taxpayers if they cannot sustain themselves through ticket sales and other forms of revenue.

I disagree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. While I understand the argument that students should be allowed to make their own choices, I believe that regular attendance is crucial for academic success. By making attendance compulsory, schools can ensure that students are exposed to the material being taught, and that they are not falling behind in their studies. Additionally, regular attendance can help students develop good habits and a sense of responsibility, which can benefit them in the long term. However, I also believe that schools should have policies in place to accommodate students who may have valid reasons for missing class, such as illness or family emergencies.</div>

I do not agree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it is true that discipline is an important part of parenting, there are many ways to discipline a child without resorting to physical punishment. Spanking can be harmful to a child&#x27;s physical and emotional well-being, and can also teach them that violence is an acceptable way to solve problems. Instead, good parents should use positive reinforcement, time-outs, and open communication to help their children learn and grow in a healthy and safe environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. I believe that the possession of marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence. This is because the criminalization of marijuana possession has not been proven to be an effective way to reduce its use. In fact, it has led to the incarceration of many individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, for non-violent offences. This not only disproportionately affects these communities, but it also wastes resources that could be used to address more serious crimes. Additionally, there is growing evidence that marijuana can have medicinal benefits, and it is already legal for medical use in many places. Therefore, I believe that the possession of marijuana for personal use should be decriminalized, and the focus should be on harm reduction and education.</div>

This is because work is a fundamental aspect of life, and it is through work that individuals can contribute to society, support themselves, and achieve their goals. By refusing to work, a person is not only depriving themselves of the benefits of employment, but they are also not fulfilling their responsibilities as a member of society. However, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this, such as individuals who are unable to work due to illness or disability, or those who are in between jobs due to no fault of their own.

I disagree with the statement that no broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding. Public funding is essential for the existence and operation of broadcasting institutions that are independent and impartial in their content. This is because these institutions are responsible for providing a platform for diverse perspectives, ideas, and opinions, which is crucial for a functioning democracy. Without public funding, these institutions may not be able to maintain their independence and impartiality, as they may have to rely on private funding, which could compromise their editorial independence. Additionally, public funding ensures that these institutions are accountable to the public, and not to private interests.

I strongly disagree with the statement that a significant advantage of a one-party state is that it avoids all the arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system. In fact, the opposite is true. A one-party state is characterized by a lack of political competition, which often leads to stagnation and a lack of innovation. In a democratic system, there are multiple parties that represent different interests and perspectives, and this diversity of opinions leads to a healthy debate and discussion. This debate is essential for progress, as it allows for the exploration of different ideas and the development of new solutions to problems. In a one-party state, there is no such debate, and as a result, progress is often hindered. Additionally, the lack of political competition in a one-party state can lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals, which can result in corruption and abuse of power.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I do not believe that the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes. I believe that there are other ways to punish criminals that do not involve taking their lives. The death penalty is a very controversial issue, and there are many arguments against it, including the possibility of executing innocent people, the high cost of the death penalty, and the fact that it does not necessarily deter crime. Additionally, I believe that taking a life is a very serious matter, and it should not be taken lightly, even in the case of a serious crime. Instead, I believe that criminals should be given a fair trial and, if found guilty, be given a sentence that is appropriate for the crime they have committed.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement because it implies a hierarchical society where some individuals have power over others, which is not necessarily true in a civilized society. In a civilized society, everyone should be equal, with the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their position or status. People should not be above or below others, but rather, they should work together to build a better community for everyone. The statement also suggests that obedience and command are the only ways to maintain order in society, which is not always the case. In a civilized society, respect, understanding, and cooperation are essential for maintaining social order.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I don&#x27;t agree with the statement that abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything shouldn&#x27;t be considered art at all. Art is a form of self-expression and can take many forms, including abstract art. Abstract art can be just as meaningful and thought-provoking as representational art, and it can evoke emotions and ideas in the viewer. The value of art is not solely determined by its ability to represent something, but rather by the impact it has on the viewer and the emotions it evokes.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

I do not agree that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. While punishment is an important aspect of the criminal justice system, it is not the only goal. Rehabilitation is also crucial in helping individuals who have committed crimes to reintegrate into society and become productive members of their communities. By focusing solely on punishment, we risk creating a cycle of recidivism and further damaging individuals and communities. Instead, a balanced approach that includes both punishment and rehabilitation is necessary to achieve justice and promote public safety.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I do not believe that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. While it is true that some individuals may be beyond rehabilitation, it is important to remember that every person is capable of change. By providing opportunities for rehabilitation, we can help individuals to turn their lives around, become productive members of society, and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending in the future. Additionally, rehabilitation can help to address the root causes of criminal behavior, such as poverty, mental health issues, and substance abuse, which can have a positive impact on the individual and the wider community.</div>

While it is important for a mother to take care of her family and maintain a healthy home environment, it is also crucial for her to have the opportunity to pursue her own goals and aspirations. A mother&#x27;s career can bring many benefits to her and her family, such as financial stability, personal fulfillment, and the ability to serve as a positive role model for her children. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have a career should be up to the individual mother, and she should not be judged or limited based on her choice.</div>

Maturity is a complex concept that involves personal growth, self-awareness, and the ability to make responsible decisions.

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. I believe that morality is a concept that is not confined to religious teachings, but is rather a universal principle that can be understood and practiced by people of all faiths and backgrounds. People can be moral because they have a sense of empathy, compassion, and fairness, and not necessarily because they follow a religious doctrine. Additionally, there are many instances of immoral behavior committed by religious people, which suggests that religious belief is not a guarantee of morality.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. While charity can be a valuable source of support for the disadvantaged, it is not a reliable or consistent means of assistance. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that provides a safety net for those in need, ensuring that they receive regular and predictable financial support. Charity, while well-intentioned, can be unpredictable and may not always be available when it is needed most. Additionally, social security is designed to be a long-term solution, while charity is often more of a short-term fix. For these reasons, I do not believe that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I do not agree that sex outside of marriage is usually immoral. I believe that the morality of sex depends on the context, the individuals involved, and their personal beliefs and values. For example, if two consenting adults are in a committed relationship and choose to have sex, I do not believe this is inherently immoral. However, if two people have sex without mutual consent or respect for each other&#x27;s boundaries, then this would be considered immoral.
