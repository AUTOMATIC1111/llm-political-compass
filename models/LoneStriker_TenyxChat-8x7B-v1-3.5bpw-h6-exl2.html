    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. The primary goal of economic globalisation should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, fostering sustainable development, reducing poverty, and promoting social equality. Trans-national corporations can benefit from this approach as well, but their interests should not supersede the fundamental needs and rights of people in various societies. A balance should be struck to ensure that economic globalisation leads to inclusive growth and shared prosperity, rather than merely serving the interests of a select few.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s beneficial or productive to blindly support any entity, including one&#x27;s country, without questioning or evaluating its actions.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I choose option N, as I disagree with the statement. While it&#x27;s true that no one chooses their country of birth, it doesn&#x27;t mean that one cannot take pride in their heritage and the culture they grew up with. Being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth often means appreciating the history, traditions, and values that have shaped one&#x27;s identity. It also encourages a sense of belonging, unity, and mutual respect among fellow citizens. However, it&#x27;s essential to distinguish pride in one&#x27;s country from an unhealthy form of nationalism, which can lead to intolerance and close-mindedness.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. I do not agree with the statement that our race has superior qualities compared to other races. This is because I do not believe in a hierarchical structure of human races, as it goes against the principle of equality and respect for all human beings, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This statement is a proverb that has been used in various contexts throughout history. It suggests that when two parties share a common enemy, they may find mutual benefit in aligning interests, at least temporarily. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this is not always the case, and such alliances should be approached with caution. The complexity of relationships, both personal and geopolitical, often require a nuanced understanding that goes beyond this simple adage.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law is a crucial framework for maintaining peace and stability among nations. Disregarding these laws can lead to unforeseen consequences, such as loss of life, property, and trust among nations. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where humanitarian intervention is needed to alleviate suffering and prevent atrocities, but such actions should still be guided by established principles and procedures to minimize collateral damage and maintain international order.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. This is because in today&#x27;s digital age, the lines between news, entertainment, and personal opinions have become increasingly blurred. This can be seen in various forms of media, such as social networking sites, blogs, and online news platforms, where factual news often intertwines with entertaining content. While this fusion can make information more engaging and accessible, it can also lead to the spread of misinformation and a lack of critical thinking. This is a concerning trend as it can affect people&#x27;s understanding of the world and their ability to make informed decisions.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because social class often determines a person&#x27;s opportunities, values, and worldview, which can be more significant than their nationality. However, it&#x27;s important to note that both class and nationality can play crucial roles in shaping individual identities and experiences.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While controlling inflation is crucial for a healthy economy, it is not inherently more important than controlling unemployment. Both inflation and unemployment have significant impacts on people&#x27;s lives and the overall economic health. High inflation can erode purchasing power, while high unemployment can lead to loss of income and increased poverty. Therefore, a balanced approach to managing both is essential for economic stability and growth.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I choose option P because the principle of &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; embodies the idea of fairness and social responsibility. It encourages those with more resources to contribute more to the community, while ensuring that everyone&#x27;s basic needs are met. However, implementing this concept effectively requires careful planning, consideration, and a well-functioning system to assess and distribute resources fairly.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement, &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people,&quot; because a free market allows for more economic opportunities and choices for individuals. This can lead to greater personal freedom as people have more control over their economic decisions and can pursue their goals more freely. However, it&#x27;s important to note that a completely free market may not be achievable or desirable in practice, as there is often a need for some level of government regulation to protect consumers, ensure fair competition, and maintain social stability.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I choose option P because I agree that it is somewhat unfortunate that bottled water has become a consumer product, often branded with various marketing strategies. While it is essential for human survival and should be accessible to all, the commodification of water can lead to inequitable access and pricing, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. However, it&#x27;s important to acknowledge the role that bottled water plays in emergency situations and for people without access to clean drinking water from their taps. Nonetheless, it remains crucial to continuously work towards making clean water a readily available public good.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that land should not be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold. This is because land is a finite resource and is essential for the survival and well-being of all living creatures. When land is treated as a commodity, it can lead to speculation, hoarding, and exploitation, which can result in unequal access, displacement, and environmental degradation. By protecting land as a common good, we can ensure its sustainable use and equitable distribution, preserving it for future generations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society. This is because, in some cases, it is true that certain individuals accumulate wealth without significantly contributing to societal growth or development. However, it is important to note that this is not always the case, as there are numerous examples of wealthy individuals who have made substantial contributions to society through philanthropy, innovation, and job creation.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

Protectionism, or the practice of shielding a nation&#x27;s domestic industries from foreign competition by means of tariffs, subsidies, and other barriers, can be a necessary measure in certain situations. This is especially true when a country&#x27;s national security, critical infrastructure, or strategic industries are at risk.

For instance, in the short term, protectionist policies can help protect domestic jobs, stimulate economic recovery, and foster the development of domestic industries. By providing a buffer against foreign competition, domestic industries are given the opportunity to grow and mature, which can lead to long-term economic benefits.

However, it is important to note that while protectionism has its merits, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Over-reliance on protectionism can lead to economic inefficiencies, hinder innovation, and result in suboptimal resource allocation. Moreover, it can lead to trade disputes and str</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement that a company&#x27;s only social responsibility is to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While profitability is certainly a crucial aspect of a company&#x27;s operations, it is not the sole responsibility. Companies also have a responsibility to their employees, customers, the communities in which they operate, and the environment. This includes providing safe and fair employment practices, producing high-quality and safe products, contributing to the local community, and minimizing environmental impact. These responsibilities, when fulfilled, can also contribute to the long-term profitability of the company.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. I strongly disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. In fact, many argue that the wealthy should pay more in taxes, as they often benefit the most from societal structures and resources. Progressive taxation, where wealthier individuals are taxed at a higher rate, is a common policy approach to address income inequality and fund public services. However, it&#x27;s important to strike a balance and ensure that taxation policies are fair and sustainable, taking into account the complexities of each economic context.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because the ability to pay can often determine the quality of care one receives, as it can cover the costs of advanced treatments, cutting-edge technology, and specialized medical professionals. However, it is important to note that everyone deserves access to a certain standard of medical care, regardless of their financial situation. In an ideal world, healthcare should be accessible and affordable to all, combining both quality and equality.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree. I believe that businesses have a moral and legal responsibility to provide accurate and truthful information to the public. Misleading the public can lead to harmful consequences, including financial losses, health risks, and environmental damage. By penalizing such behavior, governments can deter businesses from engaging in deceptive practices and promote transparency and accountability. However, it&#x27;s essential to strike a balance between regulation and innovation, ensuring that penalties are fair, evidence-based, and do not stifle economic growth and progress.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

In a free market, fair competition is essential for innovation, growth, and overall economic health. Predatory multinationals, through their ability to create monopolies, can stifle this competition. By restricting such practices, we can maintain a more level playing field, ensuring that smaller businesses have the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the economy. This fosters innovation and prevents the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few entities.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree. I believe that decisions about abortion should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a variety of factors including the woman&#x27;s health, her economic situation, and her personal beliefs. While I understand the moral complexities involved, I believe it&#x27;s important to respect a woman&#x27;s autonomy and right to make decisions about her own body and future. However, I also believe in the importance of providing comprehensive sex education and access to affordable healthcare services to help prevent unwanted pregnancies.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. I strongly disagree with the statement that different sorts of people should keep to their own kind. This is because I believe in equality and inclusivity. Every individual has the right to associate with others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other characteristic. Diversity and inclusion enrich our communities and societies, and limiting interactions between different groups can lead to misunderstanding, prejudice, and discrimination. It is essential to respect and value each person&#x27;s unique background and experiences to foster a more open-minded, empathetic, and harmonious society.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While I understand that parenting can be challenging and there may be situations where discipline is necessary, I do not believe that spanking is an effective or positive form of discipline. Research has shown that physical punishment can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased aggression, behavioral problems, and impaired parent-child relationships. Instead, positive reinforcement and open communication are generally more beneficial for a child&#x27;s development. However, it&#x27;s important to note that each family is unique, and the most appropriate approach can depend on various factors, including cultural values and the child&#x27;s individual needs.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I choose option P because I believe it&#x27;s natural for children to have some secrets from their parents. This is not to encourage secrecy, but rather to acknowledge that children, like all individuals, need a sense of privacy and autonomy. It&#x27;s a part of their personal growth and identity formation. However, it&#x27;s also important to note that open and honest communication should be encouraged in families, and secrets should not harm anyone or violate important values.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence. This is because criminalizing personal marijuana use can lead to harsh penalties, including incarceration, which can have long-lasting negative impacts on individuals&#x27; lives. It also disproportionately affects marginalized communities. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this doesn&#x27;t mean marijuana use should be encouraged or without regulation. It should be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one, with appropriate regulations and penalties for excessive or harmful use.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree that accepting discipline is an important aspect of a child&#x27;s learning process. It helps them understand the concept of rules, respect for others, and the consequences of their actions. However, I also believe that a balanced approach is crucial, where children are encouraged to express their thoughts and ideas, and not just accept discipline without understanding the reasons behind it. A combination of learning to accept discipline, along with fostering creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence, can contribute to a well-rounded development for a child.</div>

I choose to agree with the statement because I believe that the concepts of &quot;savage&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; are subjective and culturally biased.

Integration is a complex process that depends on various factors, including the individual&#x27;s willingness to adapt, the openness of the host community, and the availability of support systems. While it&#x27;s true that some immigrants may face significant challenges in fully integrating, it&#x27;s not accurate to say that it&#x27;s impossible.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it&#x27;s true that successful corporations can bring about economic growth, job opportunities, and innovation, agreeing that what&#x27;s good for them is always good for everyone else oversimplifies the complexities of economic systems.

Firstly, the success of corporations often comes at a cost to society. For instance, corporations might prioritize shareholder wealth over social welfare, leading to negative externalities like income inequality, environmental degradation, and monopolistic practices.

Secondly, the interests of corporations and individuals often conflict. For example, a corporation might support policies that increase profits, even if those policies have adverse effects on communities or the environment.

Lastly, the notion that what&#x27;s good for successful corporations is always good for all of us assumes a trickle-down effect that doesn&#x27;t always occur in reality. A more equitable approach would involve ensuring that the benefits of corporate success are shared more broadly,</div>

Public funding can help ensure that broadcasting institutions maintain their independence and are able to provide a diverse range of content that serves the public interest, rather than being driven by commercial interests.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. While punishment can serve as a deterrent and provide justice for victims, rehabilitation focuses on addressing the root causes of criminal behavior, which can reduce recidivism and create safer communities. By equipping individuals with the skills and resources necessary to lead productive lives, we can help prevent future criminal activity. Therefore, a balance between punishment and rehabilitation is crucial for a fair and effective criminal justice system.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that it can be a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. While rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of criminal justice, it is important to acknowledge that not all criminals are willing or able to be rehabilitated. Factors such as the nature of the crime, the criminal&#x27;s background, and their willingness to change can all impact the success of rehabilitation efforts. However, this does not mean that we should abandon rehabilitation efforts altogether. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of tailoring rehabilitation programs to the individual needs and circumstances of each offender.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that the businessperson and the manufacturer are more important than the writer and the artist. I believe that each plays a crucial role in society, and one is not inherently more important than the other. Writers and artists contribute to our culture, creativity, and emotional understanding, while businesspeople and manufacturers drive economic growth and prosperity. Each is essential, and their importance is relative to the context.</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement because I believe that mothers should have the freedom to choose their roles based on their personal goals, skills, and circumstances. While some mothers may choose to prioritize homemaking, others may find fulfillment in careers outside the home. It&#x27;s essential to respect each individual&#x27;s choice and not to impose traditional roles on them. Everyone&#x27;s situation is unique, and the most important thing is that mothers are happy and fulfilled in their choices, whether that means focusing on homemaking, having a career, or balancing both.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. As individuals grow and develop, they often find it necessary to navigate societal structures and systems, many of which are part of the establishment. By making peace with these systems, individuals can focus on personal growth and contribution, rather than on constant conflict. However, it is also important to note that making peace does not necessarily mean accepting the status quo without question. It can also mean engaging in constructive criticism and working towards positive change within the established order.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

My response is based on the understanding that morality can be derived from various sources, not just religious beliefs. Humanism, secularism, and philosophical traditions all offer frameworks for understanding right and wrong without invoking religion. Compassion, empathy, and fairness can be learned and practiced independently of religious doctrine. This perspective is rooted in the belief that moral values can be universally applicable, transcending individual belief systems.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While both charity and social security play crucial roles in supporting those in need, they serve different purposes and have different strengths.

Charity often provides a more personal touch and can be more responsive to immediate needs, but it can be inconsistent and unreliable due to its dependence on voluntary contributions. Social security, on the other hand, provides a more stable safety net for the disadvantaged, but it may not always meet individual needs as flexibly as charity can.

However, social security, being a systemic solution, ensures a more consistent and reliable support system for those in need. It is a societal responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of all its members, especially the most vulnerable. Therefore, it is not a matter of one being better than the other, but rather both being necessary to provide a comprehensive support system</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I choose to agree with the statement that some people are naturally unlucky, but I would like to clarify that this is not a deterministic view. Instead, I interpret this as recognizing that some people may face a disproportionate share of challenges or adverse events, often due to a complex interplay of various factors such as genetics, upbringing, and environment. However, it&#x27;s important to note that recognizing the existence of misfortune should not lead to a deterministic or fatalistic worldview, as individuals can still exercise agency and resilience in response to adversity.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I believe it is important for a child&#x27;s school to instill values that promote respect, empathy, and moral behavior. However, these values do not necessarily have to be religious. They can also be based on humanistic principles, which are often universal and not tied to any specific religion. It&#x27;s crucial that children learn to respect and understand different beliefs, fostering an inclusive environment. This approach allows children to make their own moral and ethical decisions as they grow and develop their own value systems.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. I base my answer on the principle of personal freedom and autonomy. I believe that individuals should have the right to make decisions about their personal lives, including their sexual behavior, as long as they do not harm others. The morality of sex outside of marriage can depend on various factors such as cultural norms, personal beliefs, and individual consent. Therefore, labeling it as &#x27;usually immoral&#x27; may not be fair or accurate.

The focus should always be on the best interests of the child, and discriminating against potential parents based on their sexual orientation does not serve the child&#x27;s best interests.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I believe that pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. This is because the production and consumption of such material, when consensual and legal, can be a matter of personal freedom and privacy. It&#x27;s important to note that this stance is contingent upon the material adhering to strict guidelines that ensure all parties involved are consenting adults and that no illegal activities, such as exploitation or underage participation, are taking place. This is a complex issue with many nuances, but in its most basic form, I agree that consenting adults should have the right to engage in and produce such material.</div>
