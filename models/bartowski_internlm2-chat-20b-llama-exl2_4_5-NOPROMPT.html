Economic globalisation is the process of integrating economies around the world. It is driven by the desire of trans-national corporations to increase profits and reduce costs. However, economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. This is because economic globalisation has the potential to improve the standard of living of people around the world by creating jobs, increasing trade, and promoting economic growth. It can also help to reduce poverty and inequality by providing access to education, healthcare, and other basic needs. Therefore, economic globalisation should be used to benefit humanity as a whole, rather than just a select few trans-national corporations.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement &quot;I&#x27;d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.&quot; Supporting a country blindly, without questioning its actions or decisions, can lead to perpetuating harmful practices and injustices. It is essential to hold our countries accountable for their actions and strive for continuous improvement.

Here&#x27;s a more detailed explanation of my choice:

1. **Moral Responsibility**: As individuals, we have a moral responsibility to stand up against injustice and advocate for what is right. Blindly supporting a country that engages in wrongdoing undermines our moral compass and sets a dangerous precedent for others to follow.

2. **Promoting Accountability**: Criticizing and questioning our governments when they act unjustly is crucial for promoting accountability and transparency. This helps to ensure that those in power are held responsible for their actions and that the rights and freedoms of citizens are protected.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that it is foolish to be proud of one&#x27;s country of birth. While it is true that we do not choose our country of birth, it does not diminish the significance of our nationality or the pride we can feel for it. Our country of birth is a fundamental aspect of our identity, and it is natural to feel a sense of belonging and pride in it.

Being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth is not only a personal choice but also a way to honor the culture, history, and values that have shaped us. It is a way to connect with our roots and to recognize the contributions of our ancestors and fellow citizens who have built the society we live in.

Furthermore, being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth does not mean we cannot acknowledge its flaws or work towards its improvement. In fact, it can be a driving force for positive change, as individuals who are proud of their country are more likely to take responsibility for its progress and</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that our race has many superior qualities compared to other races. This statement is problematic for several reasons:

1. **Racism and Discrimination**: This statement perpetuates the harmful belief that one race is inherently superior to others. It promotes racism and discrimination, which have no place in a just and equitable society. Every individual, regardless of their race, should be treated with respect and dignity.

2. **Lack of Scientific Basis**: There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that one race is inherently superior to another. Biological differences between races are minimal and do not translate to superiority in any meaningful sense. Race is a social construct, not a biological one, and any perceived superiority is based on cultural, historical, and societal factors, not inherent qualities.

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; This statement is a proverb that suggests that if someone is an enemy of my enemy, then they are likely to be my ally. This is because they share a common enemy, and therefore, they are more likely to work together against that enemy.

The proverb is often used to describe situations where two parties are at odds with each other, and they are both threatened by a third party. In such a scenario, the two parties may put aside their differences and form an alliance against the common enemy.

For example, if two countries are at war with each other, and a third country is threatening both of them, the two countries may put aside their differences and form an alliance against the third country. This is because they share a common enemy, and they are more likely to work together against that enemy.

I strongly disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law exists to maintain peace and stability among nations, and violating it undermines the very foundation of global order. Military actions should always adhere to international law, as it ensures that conflicts are resolved peacefully and fairly. Any deviation from this principle risks escalating conflicts, causing unnecessary harm to innocent civilians, and setting a dangerous precedent for future conflicts.

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. This is because the lines between the two have become increasingly blurred in recent years, with entertainment often incorporating elements of information and vice versa. This fusion can be seen in various forms of media, such as news programs that use sensationalized headlines to attract viewers, or reality TV shows that present staged situations as if they were real. While this fusion can make content more engaging and entertaining, it can also lead to a lack of critical thinking and a distorted understanding of reality. Therefore, it is important to be aware of this trend and strive to maintain a clear distinction between information and entertainment.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This statement is true because class differences are often more significant than nationality differences. Class differences refer to the economic, social, and educational status of individuals, which can greatly impact their opportunities, experiences, and perspectives. Nationality, on the other hand, is a more superficial distinction based on cultural and linguistic similarities, and while it can create some divisions, it is not as fundamental as class differences.

Class differences can lead to disparities in access to resources, education, healthcare, and job opportunities. For example, individuals from lower socioeconomic classes may face more challenges in accessing quality education, healthcare, and job opportunities, which can perpetuate the cycle of poverty. In contrast, individuals from higher socioeconomic classes may have greater access to resources and opportunities, leading to better life outcomes.

Nationality, while it can create some divisions, is not as fundamental as class differences. People from different nationalities can share similar class backgrounds</div>

    <div class="pre">P
I would choose option [P]. Agree.

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment for several reasons:

1. **Economic Stability**: Inflation can lead to economic instability if it is not kept under control. High inflation can erode the purchasing power of consumers, leading to a decrease in consumer spending and a slowdown in economic growth. By controlling inflation, governments can maintain economic stability and promote long-term growth.

2. **Confidence in Currency**: High inflation can lead to a loss of confidence in a country&#x27;s currency. This can result in capital flight, where investors move their money to other countries with more stable currencies. Controlling inflation helps maintain the value of a country&#x27;s currency, which is essential for international trade and investment.

3. **Cost of Living**: Inflation affects the cost of living for consumers. High inflation can lead to higher prices for goods and services, making it difficult for households to maintain their standard of living. Cont</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree that corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment and require regulation. The primary reason for this is that corporations are primarily driven by profit, and their actions are often guided by the desire to maximize profits at the expense of environmental protection. This can lead to situations where corporations prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, resulting in environmental degradation and harm to the planet.

Regulation is necessary to ensure that corporations are held accountable for their actions and are compelled to prioritize environmental protection. Without regulation, corporations may engage in practices that harm the environment, such as excessive resource extraction, pollution, and deforestation. These actions can have severe consequences for the planet, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of natural resources.

Regulation can take various forms, such as laws, policies, and standards, which can set limits on corporate behavior and require them to adopt environmentally friendly practices. For example, regulations can mandate the use of renewable energy sources</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The statement “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamental principle that underlies the concept of socialism. This principle suggests that individuals should contribute to society based on their abilities and receive benefits based on their needs. 

Strongly agreeing with this statement is rooted in the belief that it promotes fairness, equality, and social justice. By ensuring that everyone&#x27;s basic needs are met, regardless of their abilities or circumstances, this principle aims to create a more equitable society where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive.

Furthermore, this principle encourages a sense of community and mutual support, as individuals recognize their interdependence and work together to achieve common goals. It fosters a culture of cooperation and empathy, where people prioritize the well-being of others over individual gain.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The freer the market, the freer the people. I agree with this statement because a free market allows for greater competition, innovation, and consumer choice. When there are fewer restrictions on businesses and individuals, they are able to pursue their goals and make decisions that best serve their interests. This, in turn, leads to greater economic growth, job creation, and overall prosperity.

In a free market, businesses are not subject to excessive government regulation or intervention, which can stifle innovation and limit consumer choice. This allows entrepreneurs to take risks, experiment with new ideas, and create new products and services that meet the needs and wants of consumers. As a result, consumers have more options and can choose the products and services that best meet their needs.

Furthermore, a free market encourages competition, which drives down prices, improves quality, and fosters innovation. When businesses are free to compete, they must constantly innovate and improve their products and services to stay ahead of their competitors.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

Land is a finite resource that is essential for human survival. It is the foundation of our food, water, and shelter. When land is treated as a commodity to be bought and sold, it can lead to a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, exacerbating inequality and social injustice. It can also lead to deforestation, habitat destruction, and environmental degradation, which threaten the survival of countless species and the stability of ecosystems.

Furthermore, treating land as a commodity can lead to speculation and price bubbles, which can destabilize economies and cause financial crises. It can also lead to the displacement of indigenous communities and small-scale farmers, who are often the most vulnerable to the negative impacts of land commodification.

In contrast, when land is treated as a common good, it can promote social equity, environmental sustainability, and economic stability. It can ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to survive and thrive, regardless of their wealth or social status.</div>

I strongly agree that it is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society. This is because such individuals often exploit the system and the people around them for their own gain, without providing any significant value or benefit to society.

These individuals may engage in activities such as financial fraud, insider trading, or tax evasion, which not only harm the economy but also erode public trust in the financial system. They often accumulate wealth at the expense of others, such as workers who are underpaid or investors who lose their savings due to fraudulent schemes.

Furthermore, these individuals often do not contribute to society in meaningful ways. They may not invest in education, healthcare, or other public goods that benefit society as a whole. Instead, they may use their wealth to fund lavish lifestyles, further exacerbating income inequality and social disparities.

    <div class="pre">P
I choose option [P]. Agree. Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it allows countries to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition, which can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, when a country is developing its economy, protectionism can help to nurture and grow local industries, allowing them to become more competitive over time. Additionally, protectionism can be used as a tool for countries to negotiate better trade deals with other countries, as they have more leverage when they are not as reliant on foreign imports. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used judiciously and not as a long-term strategy, as it can lead to higher prices for consumers and stifle innovation. Overall, while protectionism can be necessary in certain circumstances, it should be used with caution and in conjunction with other trade policies.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

While it is true that companies have a primary obligation to their shareholders, it is not the only responsibility they have. Companies also have a responsibility to their employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate. 

Here are some reasons why I strongly disagree with the statement:

1. **Ethical Obligations**: Companies have an ethical obligation to conduct their business in a manner that is fair, just, and transparent. This includes treating employees fairly, providing safe working conditions, and ensuring that the products or services they offer do not harm society or the environment.

2. **Legal Obligations**: Companies are subject to various laws and regulations that govern their operations. Ignoring these obligations can lead to legal consequences, including fines, lawsuits, and damage to the company&#x27;s reputation.

The statement that the rich are too highly taxed is a contentious issue that has been debated for years. While some argue that the wealthy should pay more in taxes to support public services and reduce income inequality, others believe that high taxes on the rich can stifle economic growth and discourage entrepreneurship.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the reasons behind my choice:

Strongly disagree (M):

1. **Progressive taxation:** Many countries, including the United States, have a progressive tax system, where individuals with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This is based on the principle of ability to pay, where those who can afford to contribute more to public services do so. This system aims to reduce income inequality and fund essential public services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

2. **Public goods and services:** Taxes fund a wide range of public goods and services that benefit everyone, regardless of their income level. These include public education,</div>

I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because individuals who have the financial means to pay for better medical care should be able to access it. It is a matter of personal choice and responsibility, and it is only fair that those who can afford it should have access to the best possible care. Additionally, this can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life for those who can afford it. It is important to note that this does not mean that those who cannot afford it should be denied access to basic medical care. It is important to ensure that everyone has access to basic medical care, regardless of their ability to pay. However, those who can afford it should have the option to access higher standards of medical care.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because businesses have a responsibility to act ethically and transparently, and when they mislead the public, they are not fulfilling this responsibility. By penalising businesses that mislead the public, governments can send a clear message that such behaviour is not acceptable and can deter other businesses from engaging in similar practices. This can help to promote a more ethical and trustworthy business environment, which is essential for the well-being of society as a whole. In addition, penalising businesses that mislead the public can help to protect consumers from harm and ensure that they have access to accurate information. This is particularly important in industries such as healthcare, where misinformation can have serious consequences for people&#x27;s health and well-being. Overall, I believe that governments have a duty to penalise businesses that mislead the public in order to promote ethical behaviour and protect consumers.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies. Here&#x27;s why:

1. **Competition is the cornerstone of a free market**: A free market is characterized by the presence of multiple players competing for resources and customers. This competition drives innovation, efficiency, and lower prices for consumers. However, when a predator multinational creates a monopoly, it stifles competition, leading to higher prices, reduced innovation, and less consumer choice.

2. **Monopolies can lead to anti-competitive practices**: Monopolies have the power to control prices, limit supply, and dictate terms to their advantage. This can lead to anti-competitive practices such as price gouging, limiting access to raw materials, or engaging in predatory pricing to drive smaller competitors out of business.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

Abortion is a complex issue that involves a woman&#x27;s right to choose what happens to her body, religious beliefs, and the sanctity of life. While I understand that some people believe that abortion should always be illegal, I strongly disagree with this statement for several reasons.

Firstly, a woman&#x27;s right to choose what happens to her body is a fundamental aspect of reproductive freedom. This right is enshrined in many countries&#x27; constitutions and laws, and it is essential for women&#x27;s autonomy and equality. Denying women the right to make decisions about their own bodies can lead to unsafe and illegal practices, putting women&#x27;s health and lives at risk.

Secondly, the decision to have an abortion is often a difficult and personal one, influenced by various factors such as financial stability, mental and physical health, and the ability to provide for a child. Forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term against their will can lead to increased rates of poverty, mental health issues</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree that all authority should be questioned. This is because questioning authority is a fundamental aspect of democracy and critical thinking. It allows individuals to evaluate the legitimacy and effectiveness of those in positions of power, and to ensure that their actions align with the common good. By questioning authority, we can hold those in power accountable, promote transparency, and ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of society as a whole.

Furthermore, questioning authority encourages intellectual curiosity and fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement. It challenges individuals to think critically and independently, which is essential for personal growth and societal progress. By questioning authority, we can identify flaws and inefficiencies in systems and processes, leading to better decision-making and more effective governance.

In addition, questioning authority promotes diversity of thought and encourages the exploration of alternative perspectives. This can lead to more innovative solutions and a more inclusive society.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

The phrase &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; is a proverb that means &quot;retaliation&quot; or &quot;retribution.&quot; It suggests that if someone does something wrong to you, you should do the same thing back to them. This phrase is often used to justify revenge or retaliation, which is not a healthy or productive way to handle conflicts or disagreements.

Strongly disagreeing with this statement means that I believe in a more peaceful and constructive approach to resolving conflicts. Instead of retaliating with the same harm or injury that was done to us, we should seek to understand the root cause of the problem and work towards a resolution that benefits everyone involved. This approach fosters empathy, understanding, and a willingness to find common ground and solutions that benefit all parties.

In summary, I strongly disagree with the statement &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; because it promotes a cycle of violence and retaliation, rather than fost</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree that taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis. There are several reasons for this stance:

1. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Taxpayers&#x27; money should be allocated to essential public services and infrastructure, such as healthcare, education, and public safety. Subsidizing cultural institutions that can&#x27;t sustain themselves financially may divert resources from these critical areas.

2. **Market Forces**: The market should dictate the success or failure of cultural institutions. If a theatre or museum cannot attract enough visitors or donors to cover its operating costs, it may indicate that there is no strong demand for that particular type of cultural offering. In such cases, it might be more prudent to allow these institutions to close and reallocate resources to other areas of public need.

I strongly agree that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. There are several reasons why I believe this is the case:

By making attendance compulsory, schools may inadvertently discourage students from developing self-discipline and personal responsibility. Students should be given the freedom to decide whether attending class is beneficial for their learning or not.

2. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: In today&#x27;s digital age, learning can occur in various formats and locations. Students may find that they learn better through online resources, self-study, or even through hands-on projects. By not enforcing compulsory attendance, schools can accommodate different learning styles and preferences, fostering a more inclusive and adaptive educational environment.

It is important to recognize and celebrate diversity, as it enriches our society and fosters understanding and tolerance.

I agree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it is not an ideal situation, there are times when a child&#x27;s behavior requires a firm and immediate response. Spanking can be an effective form of discipline when used appropriately and in moderation. It is important to note that spanking should never be used as a form of abuse or punishment, but rather as a last resort when other forms of discipline have failed. Additionally, it is crucial for parents to understand the potential psychological effects of spanking and to use it judiciously.

I agree with the statement that it&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents. This is because children, as they grow and develop, naturally become more independent and develop their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They may not always feel comfortable sharing everything with their parents, especially if they perceive their parents as judgmental or overprotective. Additionally, children may also have secrets that they do not want to share due to fear of punishment or disapproval from their parents. It is important for parents to create a safe and open environment where children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings, but it is also important to respect their privacy and autonomy. Ultimately, it is natural for children to have some secrets from their parents, and it is important for parents to understand and respect this aspect of their child&#x27;s development.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">P
[P]. Agree

I believe that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence. There are several reasons why I hold this position.

Firstly, the criminalization of marijuana has been shown to disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly people of color. The War on Drugs, which began in the 1970s, has led to mass incarceration and the perpetuation of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Decriminalizing marijuana could help reduce these disparities and promote greater social justice.

Secondly, the health risks associated with marijuana use are relatively low compared to other substances, such as alcohol and tobacco. While marijuana can have negative effects on mental health in some individuals, the risks are generally outweighed by the potential benefits. Moreover, the risks can be mitigated through education and responsible use.

The primary goal of schooling should be to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to become active and responsible citizens who can contribute positively to society.

Every individual has the right to make their own choices about their reproductive health, and it is not the place of society to dictate who can or cannot reproduce.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that people with disabilities are just as capable of being loving and responsible parents as anyone else. They have the right to experience the joys of parenthood and to contribute to society in their own unique ways. It is not our place to judge or discriminate against them based on their disabilities.

In addition, it is important to consider the ethical implications of such a policy. Who decides which disabilities are serious enough to warrant reproductive restrictions?

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that those who are able to work and refuse the opportunity should not expect society&#x27;s support. This is because work is not only a means of financial support but also a crucial aspect of personal growth, social interaction, and self-esteem.

Firstly, work provides financial stability and independence. When individuals contribute to society through their labor, they earn a living and become self-sufficient. This not only benefits the individual but also reduces the burden on society&#x27;s resources. Refusing work opportunities means relying on others for financial support, which is unfair to those who are working hard to provide for themselves and their families.

Secondly, work plays a vital role in personal growth and development. Engaging in work allows individuals to develop new skills, gain experience, and enhance their knowledge. This, in turn, leads to personal growth and increased self-esteem. Refusing work opportunities deprives individuals of these benefits and may lead to stagnation and a</div>

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement that when you are troubled, it&#x27;s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things. This is because when we are troubled, our minds tend to dwell on negative thoughts and emotions, which can lead to a downward spiral of negative thinking. By keeping busy with more cheerful things, we can distract ourselves from these negative thoughts and emotions, allowing us to focus on positive experiences and activities. This can help us to feel better and improve our overall well-being.

Additionally, research has shown that engaging in positive activities can have a range of benefits for our mental health. For example, participating in enjoyable activities can increase our levels of happiness and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. By keeping busy with more cheerful things, we can create a positive feedback loop that helps us to feel better and improve our mental health.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

First-generation immigrants can never be fully integrated within their new country. I strongly disagree with this statement. While it is true that immigrants may face challenges in adapting to a new culture and language, it is not accurate to say that they can never be fully integrated. Integration is a complex process that involves various aspects of life, including language, culture, social networks, and economic opportunities. It is essential to recognize that integration is not a one-size-fits-all process and can vary greatly depending on the individual&#x27;s circumstances, the host country&#x27;s policies, and the immigrant&#x27;s own efforts.

Firstly, language is a significant barrier for many immigrants, but it is not insurmountable. With time, dedication, and access to language classes or immersion programs, immigrants can learn the language of their new country and communicate effectively. This, in turn, can open up more opportunities for employment, education, and social interactions.

The statement is not entirely true because while it is true that successful corporations can bring about economic growth and job creation, it does not necessarily mean that it is always good for all of us. There are instances where the success of a corporation may come at the expense of the environment, worker&#x27;s rights, or public health and safety. Additionally, the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few successful corporations can lead to economic inequality and social unrest.

I believe that broadcasting institutions, regardless of their level of independence, should receive public funding. This is because public funding can help ensure that a diverse range of voices and perspectives are represented in the media landscape. It can also support the production of high-quality content that may not be commercially viable but is important for the public interest.

Public funding can help level the playing field for independent broadcasters, who may struggle to compete with larger, commercially-driven media outlets. It can also encourage innovation and experimentation in content creation, as independent broadcasters are not bound by the same commercial pressures as larger media corporations.

Furthermore, public funding can help promote media literacy and critical thinking among the audience. By supporting a variety of viewpoints and content, the public can be exposed to a wider range of ideas and perspectives, fostering a more informed and engaged citizenry.

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement that our civil liberties are being excessively curbed in the name of counter-terrorism. The reason for my agreement is rooted in the belief that while counter-terrorism measures are necessary to protect citizens, they should not come at the cost of fundamental rights and freedoms.

In recent years, governments around the world have implemented various counter-terrorism measures, such as increased surveillance, data retention, and the use of invasive technologies. While these measures are intended to enhance public safety, they often come at the expense of privacy and civil liberties.

The justification for these measures is often based on the &quot;trade-off&quot; theory, which suggests that some degree of civil liberties infringement is acceptable if it leads to increased security. However, this trade-off is not always a fair one. The erosion of civil liberties can have long-term consequences, including the potential for abuse of power, the chilling effect on free speech and association, and the creation of a culture of fear and suspicion.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

A one-party state is a political system in which only one political party is allowed to operate. In such a system, there is no opposition party to challenge the ruling party&#x27;s decisions, and this can lead to faster decision-making and implementation of policies. This can be advantageous in certain situations, such as during times of crisis or when quick action is needed.

However, it is important to note that a one-party state can also have significant drawbacks. It can lead to a lack of accountability and transparency, as there is no opposition to hold the ruling party accountable. It can also stifle political dissent and freedom of speech, as there is no platform for alternative viewpoints to be expressed.

In conclusion, while a one-party state may avoid arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and trade-offs of such a system.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

The statement suggests that only wrongdoers should be concerned about surveillance, implying that surveillance is only targeted at those who have done something wrong. However, this is not necessarily the case. Surveillance can be used for various purposes, including public safety, crime prevention, and national security. It can also be used to monitor the activities of individuals who are not necessarily wrongdoers but are of interest for other reasons, such as potential threats to national security or public safety.

Moreover, the statement assumes that surveillance is always conducted legally and ethically. However, there have been instances where surveillance has been conducted without proper legal authorization or in violation of individuals&#x27; privacy rights. This can lead to abuses of power and violations of civil liberties.

Furthermore, the statement overlooks the potential for unintended consequences of surveillance. Even if surveillance is targeted at wrongdoers, it can still have a chilling effect on free speech and association, as individuals may self-censor their behavior out of</div>

The death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes because it serves as a deterrent to potential criminals and ensures that justice is served for the victims and their families. While some may argue that the death penalty is inhumane or that there is a risk of wrongful conviction, the benefits of the death penalty outweigh the potential drawbacks. Additionally, the death penalty can provide closure for the victims&#x27; families and send a strong message that certain crimes will not be tolerated. Overall, the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes as a means of protecting society and ensuring justice is served.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

In a civilised society, the concept of hierarchy and authority is often necessary for maintaining order and ensuring the smooth functioning of various systems. However, it is crucial to note that this hierarchy should be based on merit, expertise, and the ability to make informed decisions, rather than blind obedience or arbitrary authority.

Strongly disagreeing with the statement does not mean that one disregards the importance of hierarchy or authority altogether. Instead, it emphasises the need for a more balanced and equitable distribution of power, where individuals are encouraged to think critically, question authority when necessary, and contribute to the decision-making process.

A civilised society should foster an environment where individuals are empowered to make informed decisions, express their opinions freely, and participate in the democratic process. This approach promotes a more inclusive and participatory society, where the well-being of all members is prioritised, and the potential for growth and progress is maximised.

I believe that abstract art should be considered art because it allows for a greater degree of personal interpretation and expression. Abstract art often challenges traditional notions of representation and instead focuses on color, form, and texture to convey emotions and ideas. By removing recognizable objects or subjects, abstract art encourages the viewer to engage with the work on a more visceral level, allowing for a deeper and more personal connection.

Abstract art can evoke a range of emotions and ideas in the viewer, even if the work does not depict a specific subject or scene. The use of color, line, and form can create a visual language that speaks to the human experience, transcending the need for recognizable imagery. By embracing the abstract, artists can explore complex themes and ideas that may be difficult to express through more representational art forms.

I believe that rehabilitation should be more important than punishment in criminal justice. While punishment may serve as a deterrent and provide a sense of justice for the victim and society, it does not address the root causes of criminal behavior or help the offender to become a productive member of society.

Rehabilitation focuses on addressing the underlying issues that led to the criminal behavior, such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or a lack of education and job skills. By providing offenders with the tools and resources they need to succeed, rehabilitation can help reduce recidivism rates and prevent future criminal behavior.

Furthermore, rehabilitation can also have a positive impact on the offender&#x27;s personal growth and well-being. It can help them develop a sense of responsibility, empathy, and compassion, which can lead to a more fulfilling life and a reduced likelihood of reoffending.

I strongly disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. Rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of the criminal justice system, as it aims to help offenders reintegrate into society and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. While some individuals may present a higher risk of reoffending, it is essential to provide them with the opportunity for rehabilitation and support to help them turn their lives around.

Rehabilitation programs can include various interventions such as counseling, education, vocational training, and substance abuse treatment. These programs aim to address the underlying issues that may have contributed to the offender&#x27;s criminal behavior, such as mental health issues, addiction, or a lack of education and job skills.

The statement that the businessperson and the manufacturer are more important than the writer and the artist is a subjective matter and can vary depending on individual perspectives and societal needs. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of my reasoning:

1. **Economic Contribution**: Businesspeople and manufacturers play a crucial role in driving economic growth and innovation. They create jobs, develop new products, and contribute to the overall wealth of a nation. This contribution is often measured in terms of economic output, job creation, and technological advancements.

I strongly disagree with the statement that mothers&#x27; first duty is to be homemakers. While it is true that many mothers choose to prioritize their roles as homemakers, it is not a universal expectation or obligation. Mothers have the right to pursue their own aspirations and career goals, just as anyone else does. The idea that a mother&#x27;s primary role is to be a homemaker is outdated and limiting, as it disregards the diverse range of choices and lifestyles that mothers may have.

Furthermore, the notion that mothers should prioritize homemaking over other pursuits can create unnecessary pressure and guilt. It is important to recognize that mothers have the right to define their own roles and identities, and that these choices should be respected and supported.

I strongly agree with the statement that we should heed the warnings of climate science regarding the detrimental effects of economic growth on our efforts to curb global warming. The reasons for my agreement are as follows:

1. **Climate Change is a Global Crisis**: Climate change is a pressing issue that threatens the very existence of life on Earth. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global temperatures could rise by 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels as early as 2030, with catastrophic consequences for ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide.

I agree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity.

Making peace with the establishment can also help individuals develop important skills such as diplomacy, negotiation, and compromise. These skills are essential for building strong relationships and achieving success in various aspects of life, including personal and professional settings.

Astrology is a pseudoscience that has no basis in reality. It is based on the belief that the positions of celestial bodies at the time of a person&#x27;s birth can influence their personality and future events in their life. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Astrology is not a reliable or accurate way to predict or explain events in a person&#x27;s life. It is important to rely on scientifically validated methods and evidence-based approaches to understand and explain phenomena in the world. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that one cannot be moral without being religious. Morality is a set of principles and values that guide individuals in distinguishing right from wrong, and it is not inherently tied to religious beliefs. While religion can provide a framework for moral guidance, it is not a prerequisite for developing a moral compass.

Many individuals who do not identify with any particular religion can still exhibit moral behavior and make ethical decisions based on empathy, compassion, and a sense of fairness. Additionally, various secular philosophies and ethical systems, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics, offer alternative frameworks for moral reasoning without relying on religious doctrine.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that religious individuals may not always act in accordance with their professed beliefs. Conversely, non-religious individuals can demonstrate moral behavior without subscribing to any religious doctrine. Morality is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be shaped by various factors, including upbringing</div>

Charity is not better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. Charity is often unreliable and inconsistent, as it depends on the goodwill of individuals and organizations. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that provides a safety net for those in need. It is funded through taxes and is therefore more reliable and consistent in its distribution. Additionally, social security provides a basic level of support that can help individuals meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. While charity can supplement social security, it cannot replace it as a primary means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that some people are naturally unlucky. Luck, whether good or bad, is often a result of a combination of factors, including personal choices, circumstances, and external factors beyond one&#x27;s control. It is not accurate or fair to attribute someone&#x27;s misfortune solely to their inherent luck.

Firstly, personal choices play a significant role in shaping one&#x27;s life experiences. People who consistently make poor decisions or exhibit self-destructive behaviors may find themselves in unfavorable situations. This is not due to bad luck but rather a consequence of their actions.

Secondly, circumstances beyond an individual&#x27;s control can significantly impact their lives. For example, someone born into poverty or facing systemic barriers may struggle more than someone with more favorable starting conditions. This is not a matter of luck but rather a reflection of societal inequalities and injustices.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the idea that my child&#x27;s school should instill religious values. While I understand that religion can be an important aspect of many people&#x27;s lives, I believe that it is not the school&#x27;s responsibility to promote any particular religious beliefs. Schools should focus on providing a well-rounded education that prepares students for success in the real world, without imposing any specific religious beliefs on them.

Instead, I believe that parents should be the ones to instill religious values in their children, if they choose to do so. This can be done through family discussions, attending religious services, and participating in religious activities outside of school hours. By keeping religion separate from the school curriculum, we can ensure that all students, regardless of their religious background, are treated equally and have equal opportunities to succeed.

Furthermore, allowing religious values to be taught in schools can lead to division and conflict among students and their families. It can also create an environment where some students may feel excluded or marginal</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

Sex outside marriage is not inherently immoral. It is a personal choice that should be respected. People have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and their relationships. It is important to prioritize consent, communication, and respect in any sexual encounter, regardless of whether or not it is within the confines of a marriage.

It is important to note that morality is subjective and varies from person to person and culture to culture. What may be considered immoral by one individual or society may not be seen as such by another. Therefore, it is not appropriate to impose one&#x27;s personal beliefs or societal norms on others.

Furthermore, marriage is a social construct that has evolved over time and varies across different societies and cultures. Not everyone chooses to get married, and that is their prerogative. It is not fair or just to judge someone&#x27;s morality based on their marital status or sexual choices.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption. Here&#x27;s why:

1. **Love and Stability**: Love and stability are the most important factors in raising a child. Sexual orientation does not determine one&#x27;s ability to provide a loving and stable home for a child. Same-sex couples can offer the same love, care, and support as opposite-sex couples.

2. **Diversity and Inclusion**: Allowing same-sex couples to adopt promotes diversity and inclusion in families. Children grow up in a world that is diverse and accepting, and having same-sex parents can help them understand and appreciate different types of families.

3. **Child&#x27;s Best Interests**: The primary concern in any adoption case should be the best interests of the child. If a same-sex couple can provide a loving and stable home, it is in the child&#x27;s best interest to allow them to adopt.

    <div class="pre">P
I agree with the statement that pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. Here&#x27;s why:

1. **Adult Consent**: The age of consent varies by country and region, but in most places, adults are legally allowed to engage in sexual activities with each other. Pornography, when depicting consenting adults, is simply a visual representation of these consensual acts. Therefore, it is a natural extension of the freedom and autonomy that adults have in their personal lives.

2. **Freedom of Expression**: The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, enshrined in various international human rights treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pornography, when created and consumed responsibly, can be a form of artistic expression and a means of exploring and understanding human sexuality.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree that what goes on in a private bedroom between consenting adults is no business of the state. This is because individuals have the right to privacy and autonomy in their personal lives, and the state should not interfere in matters that do not directly impact public safety or well-being. Consenting adults should be free to make their own choices regarding their sexual activities, as long as they are not causing harm to others or breaking any laws.

Furthermore, the state&#x27;s involvement in private matters can lead to unnecessary intrusion into people&#x27;s lives, potentially violating their rights to privacy and personal freedom. It can also create an environment of fear and mistrust, where individuals may feel compelled to hide their true selves or engage in secretive behavior, which can have negative consequences on mental health and well-being.

In addition, the state&#x27;s focus should be on upholding and enforcing laws that protect public safety and well-being, rather than meddling in personal matters. By</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. Sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human identity, and it is not solely determined by biology or genetics. While there may be some biological factors that influence sexual orientation, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation is a spectrum, and individuals may experience a range of attractions and desires that fall along that spectrum.

It is essential to understand that sexual orientation is not a choice, and it is not something that can be changed or controlled. Sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person&#x27;s identity, and it is not something that can be &quot;cured&quot; or &quot;fixed.&quot; It is important to respect and affirm the sexual orientation of all individuals, regardless of their attractions or desires.

I believe that openness about sex has not gone too far. In fact, I think it&#x27;s important for people to have open and honest conversations about sex in order to promote understanding, reduce stigma, and improve sexual health. Here are some reasons why I made this choice:

1. **Promotes Understanding**: Openness about sex can help individuals understand their own bodies, desires, and preferences. This understanding can lead to better communication with partners, increased satisfaction in relationships, and reduced risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
2. **Reduces Stigma**: By discussing sex openly, we can challenge societal norms and expectations that may contribute to shame, guilt, or embarrassment around sexual topics. This can help reduce the stigma associated with sex and promote a more accepting and inclusive society.
3. **Improves Sexual Health**: Open conversations about sex can lead to better understanding of contraceptive methods, safer sex practices, and the importance of consent. This can</div>
