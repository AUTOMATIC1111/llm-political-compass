If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because economic globalization, while inevitable, should prioritize the well-being of humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations. This is because the primary goal of globalization should be to improve the quality of life for all people, rather than solely benefiting a select few. By focusing on the needs of humanity, globalization can lead to more equitable distribution of resources, better access to education and healthcare, and overall greater social and economic progress.

I strongly disagree with the statement because it implies unconditional support for one&#x27;s country without considering the morality or ethics of its actions. As an AI, I am programmed to provide information and assistance based on logic and reason, not on blind loyalty to any nation. It is important to critically evaluate the actions of any country and support them only when they are just and right.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it is true that no one chooses their country of birth, it is not necessarily foolish to be proud of it. National pride can be a source of identity, community, and shared history. It can also be a way to honor the achievements and contributions of one&#x27;s ancestors and the collective efforts of the people in that country.

However, it is important to recognize that national pride should not be used to justify discrimination or prejudice against other nationalities. It should be a source of unity and respect for diversity, rather than a tool for division and conflict.

I strongly disagree with the statement because it promotes a harmful and discriminatory ideology that is based on racial superiority.

It is important to recognize and celebrate the unique qualities and contributions of all races and cultures, rather than making comparisons or asserting superiority.

This statement is a proverb that suggests that if two parties are enemies, then the enemy of one enemy is a friend. However, this is not always true in real-life situations. Alliances and friendships are often based on shared values, goals, or interests, rather than just being against a common enemy. Additionally, the nature of relationships can be complex and dynamic, and it is not always the case that the enemy of one&#x27;s enemy becomes a friend.

I strongly disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law, including the United Nations Charter and various treaties and conventions, is established to maintain peace and security among nations. Military action that violates these laws can lead to conflict, human rights abuses, and a breakdown of the international order. It is crucial for nations to respect and uphold international law to ensure global stability and cooperation.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>

The statement highlights a concerning trend in modern media, where information and entertainment are becoming increasingly intertwined. This fusion can lead to a blurring of lines between factual reporting and sensationalized content, potentially misleading audiences and undermining the credibility of news sources. The rise of clickbait headlines, biased reporting, and the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms are examples of this worrying trend. As a result, it becomes more challenging for individuals to discern between credible sources and those that prioritize entertainment value over factual accuracy.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class divisions often lead to differences in wealth, education, and access to resources, which can have a significant impact on people&#x27;s lives and opportunities. While nationality can also be a source of division, class divisions often have a more profound and lasting impact on individuals and societies.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

Inflation and unemployment are both important economic indicators, and it is not accurate to say that one is more important than the other. Both have significant impacts on the economy and the well-being of individuals and businesses.

Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and it can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. High inflation can lead to economic instability, as it can erode the value of savings and investments, and it can make it difficult for businesses to plan and invest.

Unemployment, on the other hand, refers to the situation where people are willing and able to work but are unable to find employment. High unemployment can lead to social and economic problems, such as reduced consumer spending, increased government spending on social welfare programs, and a decrease in overall economic activity.

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because corporations, being profit-driven entities, may prioritize their financial interests over environmental protection. Without proper regulation, there is a risk that they might engage in activities that harm the environment. Regulations can help ensure that corporations operate in a way that minimizes their negative impact on the environment, thus protecting it for future generations.

This statement is often associated with the concept of communism, which is based on the idea of a classless society where the means of production are owned collectively and wealth is distributed according to individual need.

I choose to agree with this statement because it embodies the principle of fairness and equality. It suggests that resources should be distributed in a way that ensures everyone has their basic needs met, regardless of their ability to contribute to the community. This can lead to a more equitable society where no one is left behind due to lack of resources.

However, it&#x27;s important to note that implementing such a system in practice can be complex and challenging. It requires a high level of trust, cooperation, and a well-functioning system of governance to ensure that resources are distributed fairly and efficiently. Additionally, it&#x27;s crucial to strike a balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility to avoid potential issues such as over-reliance on the state</div>

[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people&quot; suggests that a more open and competitive market allows for greater individual freedom. This is because a free market typically involves less government intervention, which can lead to more choices and opportunities for individuals.

However, it&#x27;s important to note that while a free market can promote individual freedom, it&#x27;s not the only factor that contributes to overall freedom. Other factors such as social, political, and economic conditions also play significant roles in determining the level of freedom experienced by individuals.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement to some extent, as a free market can contribute to individual freedom. However, it&#x27;s crucial to consider other factors that influence overall freedom as well.

I strongly agree with the statement because it highlights a concerning trend in our society. The fact that drinking water, which is a fundamental human need, has become a branded and bottled consumer product indicates a shift in priorities. This shift can be seen as a reflection of the commercialization of basic human needs, which is not only unnecessary but also unsustainable. It also raises questions about access to clean water and the impact of plastic waste on the environment.

I strongly agree with the statement that land should not be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a finite resource that is essential for the survival and well-being of all living beings. Treating land as a commodity can lead to various negative consequences, such as environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and social inequalities. It is important to recognize the intrinsic value of land and to manage it in a way that is sustainable and equitable for all.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Protectionism, or the practice of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, can sometimes be necessary in trade. This is because it can help to ensure the survival and growth of domestic industries, especially in cases where there is a risk of foreign competition leading to the collapse of domestic industries. Additionally, protectionism can be used as a tool to negotiate better trade deals or to protect national security interests. However, it is important to note that excessive protectionism can lead to negative consequences, such as higher prices for consumers and reduced economic efficiency.

I strongly disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While profit is an important aspect of a company&#x27;s success, it is not the sole responsibility. Companies also have a responsibility to their employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. This includes ensuring fair labor practices, providing safe and healthy work environments, and contributing to the well-being of society as a whole. A company&#x27;s social responsibility extends beyond financial gains and should encompass ethical, environmental, and social considerations.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. The primary reason for this disagreement is that the tax system in many countries is designed to be progressive, meaning that individuals with higher incomes are subject to higher tax rates. This progressive taxation is intended to reduce income inequality and ensure that the wealthy contribute more to the public good.

Moreover, the rich often have access to various tax avoidance strategies, such as offshore accounts, trusts, and other financial instruments that can help them minimize their tax liabilities. This means that even with higher tax rates, the actual tax burden on the wealthy may not be as high as it appears on paper.

Additionally, the argument that the rich are too highly taxed often overlooks the fact that the wealthy benefit from a wide range of public goods and services, such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are funded by taxes. Ensuring that the wealthy</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because the ability to pay often correlates with the ability to afford better healthcare services, which can lead to improved health outcomes. Additionally, providing higher standards of care to those who can afford it can help reduce the burden on public healthcare systems, allowing them to focus more on providing care to those who cannot afford it. However, it is important to ensure that there are safety nets in place to provide basic healthcare to those who cannot afford it, to maintain a fair and equitable healthcare system.

By penalising such businesses, governments can help to maintain a fair and honest marketplace.

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

A genuine free market is characterized by competition among various businesses, which leads to innovation, efficiency, and better products or services for consumers. However, when a single company or a small group of companies dominate a market, it can lead to a lack of competition, higher prices, and reduced consumer choice. This situation, known as a monopoly, can be detrimental to the functioning of a free market.

Predator multinationals, which are large corporations that engage in aggressive business practices, can create monopolies by acquiring or suppressing competitors, thereby reducing competition and potentially harming consumers and smaller businesses.

Therefore, it is important to have restrictions in place to prevent such companies from creating monopolies. These restrictions can include antitrust laws, regulations on mergers and acquisitions, and other measures designed to maintain a level playing field for all businesses.

I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. This is because the decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one, and it should be up to the individual to make that choice based on their own circumstances and beliefs. Additionally, making abortion illegal in such cases can lead to unsafe and potentially life-threatening procedures, as well as infringe on a person&#x27;s right to make decisions about their own body.

The principle of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is a concept of retributive justice, where the punishment is equivalent to the harm caused. This principle is often associated with the Old Testament of the Bible and is sometimes used to justify revenge or retaliation.

I strongly disagree with this principle for several reasons:

1. It promotes a cycle of violence and retaliation, which can escalate conflicts and lead to further harm.
2. It does not consider the possibility of forgiveness, reconciliation, or rehabilitation, which are important aspects of resolving conflicts and promoting peace.
3. It does not take into account the context and circumstances surrounding the harm caused, which can lead to unfair and disproportionate punishments.

I disagree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. While it is important to foster a sense of responsibility and self-motivation in students, there are several reasons why classroom attendance should be compulsory.

Firstly, regular classroom attendance helps to ensure that students receive a consistent and comprehensive education. By attending classes, students are more likely to stay on track with their coursework and benefit from the structured learning environment provided by schools.

Secondly, compulsory attendance promotes a sense of discipline and accountability among students. It encourages them to develop good study habits and time management skills, which are essential for their future academic success and personal growth.

Lastly, compulsory attendance allows teachers to monitor students&#x27; progress and provide timely support and interventions when needed. This helps to identify and address any learning difficulties or challenges that students may be facing, ultimately contributing to their overall academic achievement.</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement because it promotes segregation and discrimination based on differences among people. This goes against the principles of equality and human rights, which state that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background, race, religion, or any other characteristic. Encouraging people to stay within their own kind is not only unethical but also counterproductive to fostering a diverse and inclusive society.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it is true that discipline is an important aspect of parenting, there are many other methods of discipline that are more effective and do not involve physical punishment. Spanking can lead to negative consequences, such as fear, anxiety, and a lack of trust between the parent and child. Instead, positive reinforcement, clear communication, and setting boundaries can help children learn and grow in a healthy and supportive environment.

    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

It&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Children keeping some secrets from their parents is a natural part of growing up. As children develop their sense of self and individuality, they may want to explore and experience things independently, without the immediate involvement or knowledge of their parents. This can be a healthy aspect of personal growth, as it allows children to learn from their own experiences and make decisions on their own.

However, it is important for parents to maintain open communication with their children and create a safe space for them to share their thoughts and feelings. This balance between independence and parental guidance can help children develop a strong sense of self while still feeling supported and loved by their family.

    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree

[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offense. My reasoning is based on several factors:

1. Personal Freedom: Adults should have the freedom to make choices about their personal lives, including what they consume, as long as it does not harm others.

2. Health and Safety: Decriminalizing marijuana possession allows for better regulation and control over its quality and distribution, which can lead to safer consumption.

3. Reduced Crime: By removing the criminal element associated with marijuana possession, it can reduce the involvement of organized crime in the drug trade.

4. Resource Allocation: Decriminalization can free up law enforcement resources to focus on more serious crimes, rather than spending time and resources on low-level drug offenses.

5. Public Health: Decriminalization can lead to better public health outcomes, as individuals may be more likely to seek help</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs. While education should provide students with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the workforce, it should also focus on developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills. Education should not be solely focused on job preparation, but rather on fostering well-rounded individuals who can contribute positively to society in various capacities.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that people with serious inheritable disabilities should not be allowed to reproduce. This statement is discriminatory and goes against the principles of human rights and equality. Every individual, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, has the right to make their own choices, including the decision to have children. It is not the place of society or the government to dictate who can and cannot reproduce. Additionally, it is important to recognize that disabilities do not define a person&#x27;s worth or potential contributions to society.

The most important thing for children to learn is to accept discipline.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While discipline is important for children to learn, it is not the most important thing for them to learn. Children should also be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills, creativity, empathy, and a love for learning. A well-rounded education that focuses on these areas can help children grow into well-adjusted and successful adults.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that there are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures. This perspective acknowledges the diversity of human societies and recognizes that all cultures have their own unique characteristics, values, and ways of life. It also challenges the notion of a hierarchy of cultures, where some are considered more &quot;civilised&quot; than others. By recognizing the complexity and richness of different cultures, we can foster greater understanding and respect among different groups of people.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and the value of work. When individuals have the ability to work and choose not to, they are making a conscious decision to not contribute to society. In a society where resources are limited, it is reasonable to expect that those who are able to work should do so in order to support themselves and contribute to the community. By refusing to work, they are not fulfilling their societal obligations, and therefore, it is not unreasonable for society to not provide support to them.
