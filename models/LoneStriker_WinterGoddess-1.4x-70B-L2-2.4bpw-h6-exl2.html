    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I believe that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations because it is important to ensure that the benefits of globalization are distributed fairly and equitably among all people. This will help to reduce inequality, promote social justice, and contribute to overall global prosperity. By prioritizing humanity over corporate interests, we can create a more balanced and sustainable global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I believe that supporting one&#x27;s country blindly, whether it is right or wrong, is not a responsible way to approach patriotism. It is important to question and challenge actions taken by the government, especially when they may be morally or ethically questionable. While I love my country and am proud of it, I also believe that it is important to hold it accountable for its actions and strive for continuous improvement.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because while it&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t choose our country of birth, it&#x27;s not foolish to be proud of it. Pride in one&#x27;s country can stem from a variety of factors, such as shared values, cultural heritage, and personal experiences. While country of birth may not be a choice, the pride one feels for their country is a personal choice and can be a valid emotion.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because it implies that one race is superior to another, which is not true. All races have their own unique qualities and strengths, and none is inherently superior to another. It is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity and value of each race, rather than comparing them in terms of superiority.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; because it is too simplistic and does not account for the complexities of relationships and alliances. In reality, the enemy of one&#x27;s enemy may not necessarily be a friend. The relationship between the two parties could be neutral or even hostile. This statement oversimplifies the dynamics of relationships and alliances, and does not account for the nuances and complexities that exist in real-life situations.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because international law is established to maintain order and peace among nations. Military action that defies international law can lead to chaos and conflict, which can have negative consequences for all parties involved. While there may be exceptions, it is generally not justified to defy international law.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because there is a growing trend of blending information and entertainment, especially in the media and online platforms. This fusion can make it difficult to distinguish between factual information and entertainment, potentially leading to misinformation or confusion.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because class often determines a person&#x27;s opportunities, lifestyle, and social status. While nationality can influence these factors, class plays a more significant role in shaping a person&#x27;s experiences and interactions with others.</div>
</div></div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. While inflation can have a significant impact on the economy, unemployment has a more direct effect on the lives of individuals and families. High unemployment rates can lead to increased poverty, reduced income, and decreased social mobility. Controlling unemployment helps to ensure that people have jobs and can provide for themselves and their families. While inflation is important to manage, it is not as crucial as controlling unemployment, as unemployment has a more direct impact on people&#x27;s lives and well-being.</div>

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.

    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">0.75%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">15.72%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">40.14%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">43.4%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because corporations, like any other business entity, are primarily focused on profit maximization. This often leads them to prioritize their bottom line over environmental concerns. Without regulation, corporations would likely continue their environmentally harmful practices, as they would not be incentivized to change their behavior. Regulations help ensure that corporations take responsibility for their environmental impact and encourage them to adopt more sustainable practices.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it promotes equality and fairness in society by ensuring that everyone&#x27;s needs are met according to their requirements. This principle encourages a supportive and inclusive community where people help each other based on their abilities and needs, creating a more harmonious and balanced society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because a free market allows individuals to make choices and decisions without interference from the government or other external forces. This freedom leads to greater autonomy and independence for people, which ultimately leads to a freer society.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: bottledwater</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because it highlights the unfortunate reality that even something as essential as water has become a commodity in our society. The privatization of water has led to the commercialization of a basic human need, turning it into a branded consumer product. This not only raises concerns about the ethics of treating water as a commodity but also raises questions about the accessibility and affordability of clean drinking water for everyone.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a finite resource, and it is essential for human survival. It is not something that should be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold like any other commodity. Land is a vital resource that should be treated with respect and care, and it should be used responsibly to ensure the well-being of future generations.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because it is unfortunate that some individuals make large amounts of money by manipulating financial systems without contributing anything positive to society. These people often exploit loopholes and take advantage of others, rather than contributing to the betterment of society through innovation, job creation, or other positive actions. This behavior can lead to inequality and social injustice, as resources are concentrated in the hands of a few individuals who do not contribute to the overall well-being of society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism can be useful in certain situations, such as protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, safeguarding infant industries, or maintaining national security. However, it should be used sparingly and strategically, as excessive protectionism can lead to trade wars and economic isolation.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because a company&#x27;s social responsibility extends beyond just delivering a profit to its shareholders. A company should also consider its impact on the environment, the well-being of its employees, and the community it operates in. Companies have the power to influence society positively or negatively, and they should take responsibility for their actions and their impact on the world around them.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. In many countries, the rich often have access to tax loopholes and deductions that allow them to pay less taxes than the average citizen. Additionally, the rich often have more resources to hire professionals to help them navigate the tax system, further reducing their tax burden. While it is true that some countries may have high tax rates for the rich, overall, the rich are often able to avoid paying the full amount of taxes they owe.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because I believe that those who can afford higher standards of medical care should have access to them. This is because having the ability to pay for better healthcare means that individuals can receive more advanced treatments, better facilities, and potentially better outcomes. This can lead to a higher quality of life and improved health outcomes for those who can afford it. However, it is important to note that this should not mean that those who cannot afford higher standards of medical care should be denied access to basic healthcare services. Everyone should have access to basic healthcare, regardless of their financial situation.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. Misleading the public is a form of dishonesty and deception, and it is important for governments to ensure that businesses are held accountable for their actions. This not only protects the public from being deceived but also promotes ethical business practices. By penalizing businesses that mislead the public, governments can help create a fairer and more transparent marketplace where consumers can make informed decisions based on accurate information.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies. This is because allowing predator multinationals to create monopolies can lead to market dominance, which can stifle competition and limit consumer choice. By restricting their ability to create monopolies, the market can remain competitive and diverse, allowing for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because I believe that abortion should not always be illegal, even when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. The decision to have an abortion is a personal choice that should be made by the individual, and it is not always necessary to have a life-threatening situation to justify the decision. The circumstances surrounding the pregnancy, such as financial stability, health concerns, or personal beliefs, can all be factors that influence the decision to have an abortion.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that all authority should be questioned. Questioning authority is essential for critical thinking and personal growth. It allows individuals to evaluate the legitimacy of the authority and the decisions made by those in power. This process can lead to a better understanding of the motivations and intentions of those in authority, and can help prevent abuses of power. By questioning authority, individuals can also ensure that they are making informed decisions and not blindly following those in power.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because theatres and museums should be able to survive on their own, without the need for taxpayer support. If they cannot survive on a commercial basis, it suggests that there is not enough public interest or demand for the services they provide. As a result, it would be unfair to force taxpayers to support these institutions when they are not generating enough revenue to sustain themselves.</div>

I believe that schools should make classroom attendance compulsory because it helps students develop a sense of responsibility and discipline.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that it&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents. Children often have a desire for privacy and independence, and keeping secrets can be a way for them to explore their own identities and develop a sense of autonomy. This is a normal part of growing up and becoming more independent. However, it&#x27;s important to note that secrets should not be harmful or dangerous, and parents should be aware of any potential issues that may arise from secrets being kept.</div>

I believe that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offense because it is a matter of personal choice and does not harm others.

I strongly agree with the statement because in the name of counter-terrorism, governments around the world have implemented laws and policies that significantly restrict civil liberties. For instance, the USA Patriot Act, passed after the 9/11 attacks, expanded the government&#x27;s surveillance powers and allowed for the monitoring of citizens without probable cause. Similarly, the UK&#x27;s Investigatory Powers Act grants the government sweeping powers to monitor and collect data on citizens.

I disagree with the statement because the electronic age has made surveillance easier for everyone, not just wrongdoers.

This is because of the widespread use of technology and the increasing amount of personal information that is stored and shared online.

I believe that the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes because it serves as a deterrent for potential criminals and helps to provide closure for victims and their families.

Abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything can still be considered art because it is an expression of the artist&#x27;s creativity and imagination. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t represent anything doesn&#x27;t make it any less artistic.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because the importance of a businessperson or manufacturer is not inherently greater than that of a writer or artist. Each individual contributes to society in their own unique way, and their importance is subjective and dependent on the context. In some cases, a businessperson or manufacturer may be more important, while in others, a writer or artist may be more important. It is not possible to definitively rank the importance of these roles.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because it implies that a mother&#x27;s primary responsibility is to be a homemaker, which is not necessarily true for all mothers. Many mothers have careers and successfully balance their work and family life. The idea that a mother&#x27;s first duty is to be a homemaker is outdated and does not reflect the diverse roles mothers play in society today.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because it highlights the importance of considering the environmental impact of economic growth. Climate science has shown that unchecked economic growth can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and other negative environmental consequences. Politicians should be aware of these consequences and work towards sustainable economic growth that balances economic prosperity with environmental protection.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because making peace with the establishment often involves accepting the reality of the world and learning to navigate it effectively. This demonstrates maturity and growth, as it requires understanding and adapting to the world around us, rather than fighting against it. Additionally, it shows an ability to cooperate and collaborate with others, which is an important skill for personal and professional growth.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because morality and religion are separate concepts. Morality refers to principles of right and wrong behavior, while religion involves belief in a divine power or powers. A person can be moral without being religious, as morality can be based on personal values, cultural norms, or ethical principles.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because social security is a more reliable and consistent means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. Charity can be helpful, but it is often dependent on the generosity of individuals and organizations, which can be inconsistent and unpredictable. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-funded program that provides a safety net for those in need, ensuring that they receive consistent support. While charity can supplement social security, it is not a better alternative to social security as the primary means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because I believe that luck is not determined by natural factors, but rather by the choices we make and the situations we find ourselves in. While some people may seem to have more misfortune than others, it is often due to the decisions they make or the circumstances they face, not an inherent &quot;unluckiness.&quot;</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I believe that religious values should be taught at home by parents, not in school. Schools should focus on providing a well-rounded education that includes academics, arts, and physical education, while leaving religious instruction to the family. This helps maintain the separation of church and state, and allows families to teach their own beliefs according to their personal convictions.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I believe that same-sex couples should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption because they are capable of providing a loving and stable home for a child in need of a family. Sexual orientation should not be a factor in determining whether a couple is fit to adopt a child. The most important aspect of adoption should be the ability of the couple to provide a loving, caring, and stable environment for the child.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that pornography depicting consenting adults should be legal for the adult population because it is a form of expression and personal choice. As long as all parties involved are consenting adults, there should be no reason to restrict their freedom of expression. However, it is important to ensure that minors are protected from exposure to such content and that non-consensual or illegal activities are not depicted.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because openness about sex can be beneficial in many ways. It can help people to better understand their bodies, sexuality, and relationships. It can also lead to more honest and open discussions about sexual health, which can help prevent sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. However, it is important to maintain a balance and ensure that discussions about sex are age-appropriate and respectful.</div>
