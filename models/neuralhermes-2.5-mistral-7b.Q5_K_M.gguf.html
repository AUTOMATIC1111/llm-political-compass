    <div class="pre">Q. I agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Economic globalisation, which refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world&#x27;s economies through trade, investment, and movement of capital, labor, and transfer of technology and knowledge across borders, can indeed bring about numerous benefits such as increased efficiency, innovation, and improved living standards. However, it is crucial that it benefits all stakeholders, particularly the people and nations involved, rather than just a select few corporations. By prioritizing humanity, we can ensure fair distribution of wealth, reduce inequalities, and promote sustainable development.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. While patriotism is important, it is also crucial to critically evaluate the actions of one&#x27;s country and support it when it is right, but also voice concerns and work towards improvement when it is wrong. This fosters a healthier society and promotes growth and learning.</div>

    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because while one doesn&#x27;t choose their country of birth, it is natural to feel a sense of pride and attachment to the place where they were born, as it shapes their identity, culture, and experiences. People can be proud of their country&#x27;s achievements and values, but not necessarily blindly nationalistic.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because it is subjective and based on personal opinions, as well as the fact that every race possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, and it is not fair to compare them based on arbitrary criteria. People from different backgrounds contribute to the world&#x27;s richness and diverse culture.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. This proverb, often attributed to the ancient Roman poet Ennius, suggests that in certain situations, it may be beneficial to form alliances or cooperate with those who oppose a common adversary, even if they are not ideal partners. However, it&#x27;s essential to consider context and evaluate the potential consequences of such alliances carefully, as it might lead to unintended negative outcomes.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified because international law is established to maintain peace, protect human rights, and ensure order among nations. Disregarding it can lead to chaos and conflicts, and it is crucial to respect and uphold these rules to preserve global stability and security.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree because the increasing integration of information and entertainment in various media platforms, such as news outlets and social media, has led to a blurred line between factual content and sensationalized or misleading information, potentially causing confusion and misinformation for the public.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: classthannationality</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">2.64%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">63.94%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">21.73%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">11.69%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">N. While nationality and cultural differences can also create divisions, I believe that class differences have a significant impact on people&#x27;s experiences, opportunities, and perspectives, but it is not accurate to say that they are more divisive than nationality. Nationality often forms the basis of identity, laws, and political affiliations, which can lead to conflicts and disparities.</div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: inflationoverunemployment</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.

[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">1.87%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">80.53%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">10.72%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">6.87%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">N. While both inflation and unemployment are crucial aspects of economic management, I disagree that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Unemployment affects people&#x27;s livelihoods and societal well-being more directly, as it leads to financial insecurity, reduced consumer spending, and can cause long-term economic stagnation. Inflation, though undesirable, can sometimes be managed through smart fiscal and monetary policies without causing significant harm if kept moderate.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I agree with the statement because corporations often prioritize profit and growth over environmental concerns, and regulation helps enforce rules and guidelines to minimize negative impacts on the environment.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: fromeachability</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; as it promotes fairness and equality in resource distribution, encouraging individuals to contribute based on their capabilities while ensuring that everyone receives what they need to thrive and maintain a balanced society.</div>
</div></div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people&quot; because a more open and competitive market generally allows for increased choice, innovation, and economic opportunities, which can lead to greater individual freedom and autonomy for consumers and businesses. However, it&#x27;s essential to consider various factors like social and political contexts, as well as potential drawbacks, to ensure that such freedom benefits everyone equitably.</div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: bottledwater</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.

[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I agree with this statement because the commercialization of something as essential as drinking water has led to environmental concerns, increased costs for consumers, and promotes single-use plastic waste, which negatively impacts our planet.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: landcommodity</span>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because while I understand the concerns about the commercialization of land and its potential negative impacts on communities and the environment, land ownership and transactions can facilitate responsible development, resource management, and provide a means for people to secure their livelihoods and investments. However, it should be regulated and balanced with environmental and social considerations.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. While I understand that some individuals who amass great wealth may not directly contribute to society in traditional ways like volunteering or public service, they might still contribute through job creation, philanthropy, or innovation that benefits others. Wealth creation can have indirect positive impacts on society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Protectionism can be beneficial in certain situations, as it aims to safeguard domestic industries and jobs, promote economic stability, and encourage local innovation.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because I believe that while generating profit is important for a company&#x27;s sustainability, it is not the sole social responsibility.

    <div class="pre">P.

    <div class="pre">P.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because I believe that every individual has the right to make decisions about their own body and health, and in some cases, abortion can be a difficult and personal choice. It should be a woman&#x27;s right to decide what is best for her situation, considering various factors such as her physical and mental well-being, and it should not be restricted by law.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; as it promotes retaliation and violence rather than seeking peaceful resolutions and forgiveness in conflicts. It encourages a cycle of revenge, which can lead to further harm and suffering instead of promoting understanding and healing.</div>

    <div class="pre">N.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious because morality can be derived from various sources, including personal beliefs, cultural values, and philosophical principles, not just religious teachings. People can have moral values and make moral decisions based on their own conscience, empathy, and understanding of right and wrong without adhering to any specific religious beliefs.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. While both charity and social security serve important purposes in assisting those in need, I disagree with the statement that charity is inherently better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. Charity can be unpredictable and inconsistent, relying on the generosity of individuals and organizations, whereas social security is a structured government program designed to provide a safety net for those in need. Social security ensures a more stable and reliable support system for the disadvantaged, as it is funded through taxes and has established guidelines and protections in place.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that some people are naturally unlucky because luck is often influenced by various factors such as personal choices, circumstances, and external events, and it is not solely determined by an inherent trait. People may perceive their experiences as unlucky due to their perspective or the way they interpret events, but luck is not a fixed attribute that someone is born with.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. While I understand that some families may find it valuable for their child&#x27;s school to instill religious values, I believe it is essential for education to focus on providing a well-rounded academic and moral foundation, allowing students to develop their own beliefs and respect for diverse perspectives.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because I believe that personal beliefs and values regarding sexual activity outside of marriage can vary greatly among individuals and cultures, and it is essential to respect each person&#x27;s right to make their own choices about their relationships and intimate lives. Morality is subjective and should not be universally imposed.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption because every child deserves a loving and supportive home, regardless of their parents&#x27; sexual orientation. Adoption should be based on the ability to provide a nurturing environment and care, not on the parents&#x27; gender or sexual preferences. It&#x27;s crucial to prioritize the best interests of the child and ensure they grow up in a safe, stable, and caring environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">P.
