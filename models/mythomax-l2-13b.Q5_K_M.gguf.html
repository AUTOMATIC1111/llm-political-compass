    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. Economic globalisation is a complex phenomenon that has both positive and negative impacts on societies and the environment. While it has led to increased trade, investment, and technological advancements, it has also contributed to income inequality, exploitation of labour, and environmental degradation. It is crucial that economic globalisation serves the interests of all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and the planet, rather than just trans-national corporations. Governments and international organisations should work together to create a more equitable and sustainable global economic system that benefits everyone.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. 

As a citizen of a country, it is natural to feel a sense of loyalty and patriotism towards one&#x27;s homeland. This loyalty should not be blind, however, and it is important to acknowledge when our country makes mistakes or engages in actions that are not in line with our values. Nevertheless, supporting one&#x27;s country does not mean condoning everything it does; rather, it means standing by it during difficult times and working towards positive change when necessary. By doing so, we can contribute to the betterment of our society and promote the ideals that make our country great.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I strongly agree with this statement. Being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth is not necessarily about choosing it, but rather about appreciating the unique aspects of the culture, history, and people that make up that nation. It&#x27;s about recognizing the contributions of those who came before us and the opportunities we have to shape our future. While it&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t choose where we are born, we can choose how we respond to our circumstances and what we do with the opportunities afforded to us. Being proud of one&#x27;s country can inspire a sense of responsibility and commitment to making a positive impact on the world, regardless of where we were born.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement &quot;Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races&quot; because it implies that there is a specific race being referred to, and within that race, there are inherent qualities that make it superior to others. This statement could be interpreted in different ways, but if we assume that the speaker is referring to the human race, then it is possible to agree with the statement.

Humans are a diverse species with unique physical and cognitive abilities. Some individuals or groups may excel in certain areas due to genetic predispositions, cultural influences, or environmental factors. For example, some populations may have a higher prevalence of certain genetic traits that confer resistance to certain diseases. Similarly, certain cultures may value and promote intellectual pursuits, leading to higher levels of achievement in those areas.

However, it is important to note that superiority is often relative and context</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; This is because it suggests that when two people or groups are in conflict, it can be beneficial for a third party to align themselves with one of the opposing sides. This strategy can be used to gain an advantage or to weaken the power of the common enemy. While this approach may not always lead to long-term alliances or positive outcomes, it can be a practical way to navigate complex situations where there are multiple competing interests.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. This is because there are instances where the protection of human rights and national security may supersede the strict adherence to international law. For example, if a country is facing an immediate threat from another country that has shown no regard for international norms or agreements, then taking military action may be necessary to prevent further harm. Additionally, if a country is facing a humanitarian crisis caused by another country&#x27;s actions, such as genocide or mass atrocities, then military intervention may be justified to protect innocent civilians. However, it is important to note that any military action should be taken as a last resort and with the utmost caution to minimize civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that there is a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. In today&#x27;s digital age, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between news and entertainment content. Social media platforms, news websites, and even traditional media outlets often prioritize clickbait headlines and sensationalist stories over factual reporting. This blurring of lines can lead to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, as well as a general decline in media literacy among the public. Additionally, the pressure to monetize content through advertising and other revenue streams can incentivize content creators to prioritize entertainment value over informative content. Overall, while there are certainly benefits to the convergence of information and entertainment, there are also significant risks that must be addressed.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class is a socio-economic construct that determines a person&#x27;s access to resources, opportunities, and power. It shapes their worldview, values, and lifestyle. On the other hand, nationality is primarily a legal and political construct that defines a person&#x27;s citizenship and affiliation with a particular country. While nationality can influence cultural identity and historical experiences, it does not necessarily determine a person&#x27;s social status or economic circumstances. Therefore, class divisions often cut across national boundaries and create deeper fissures within societies than nationality alone.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and if left unchecked, it can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, making it harder for people to afford basic necessities. On the other hand, unemployment refers to the percentage of the labor force that is currently without work but actively seeking employment. While high unemployment rates are undesirable, they can be addressed through various policies such as job creation programs and fiscal stimulus packages. However, controlling inflation requires a different approach, such as implementing monetary policies like raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, which can have negative effects on economic growth and employment in the short term. Therefore, in the long run, controlling inflation is crucial for maintaining a stable economy and the well-being of the</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. Corporations are primarily driven by profit maximization, and without regulation, they may prioritize short-term gains over long-term environmental sustainability. Regulation ensures that companies adhere to certain standards and guidelines, protecting the environment and public health. Additionally, regulation can level the playing field for smaller companies that may not have the resources to comply with environmental standards on their own. Overall, while self-regulation by corporations can be beneficial, it is not sufficient to ensure adequate protection of the environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; as a fundamentally good idea. This principle, also known as the principle of distributive justice, suggests that individuals should contribute to society based on their abilities and receive resources based on their needs. It promotes fairness and equality while recognizing individual differences and efforts. In a society where everyone contributes what they can and receives what they require, there is less room for inequality and more opportunity for collective growth and prosperity. However, implementing this principle in practice can be challenging and requires careful consideration of individual circumstances, resource allocation, and the overall well-being of society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people.&quot; This is because a free market economy allows individuals to make their own choices and decisions about what they want to buy, sell, and produce. It promotes competition, innovation, and efficiency, which can lead to economic growth and prosperity. When people have more economic freedom, they have more choices and opportunities in other aspects of their lives as well. Additionally, a free market encourages entrepreneurship and self-reliance, which are essential for personal growth and independence. Therefore, I strongly agree that a free market is beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that it&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product. The fact that we have transformed a natural resource into a commodity that is sold for profit highlights the extent to which our society values material gain over essential needs. Not only does this practice contribute to environmental degradation through excessive plastic waste, but it also perpetuates inequality by making clean drinking water inaccessible to many people around the world. Instead of treating water as a human right, we have turned it into a luxury item that is often marketed aggressively and priced beyond the reach of those who need it most. This trend reflects a troubling shift in our priorities and a disregard for the common good.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

Land is a finite resource that is essential for human survival and development. It is the foundation upon which our societies and economies are built. However, the current system of land ownership and management often leads to inequalities, exploitation, and environmental degradation. When land is treated as a commodity, it can be bought and sold like any other product, leading to speculation and land grabbing by wealthy individuals and corporations. This can result in displacement of communities, loss of cultural heritage, and destruction of ecosystems.

Moreover, the privatization of land can lead to monopolization of resources, limiting access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter. It also undermines the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities who have traditionally relied on and managed their lands sustainably.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. While it is true that some individuals who manipulate money may contribute to their society through philanthropy or other means, there are many who do not. These individuals often prioritize personal gain and wealth accumulation over the well-being of others, leading to growing income inequality and social disparities. Furthermore, the financial sector&#x27;s focus on short-term profits can lead to harmful practices that negatively impact society, such as predatory lending or environmental degradation.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries in order to protect domestic industries and jobs. While free trade is generally considered beneficial for economic growth and efficiency, there are situations where protectionism can be justified. For example, if a domestic industry is facing unfair competition from foreign producers who benefit from subsidies or dumping, temporary protectionist measures such as tariffs or quotas may be necessary to level the playing field. Additionally, during periods of economic crisis or structural change, governments may choose to protect certain industries to maintain employment and prevent social unrest. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, as it can lead to inefficiencies, higher prices for consumers, and potential retaliation from trading partners.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. The primary responsibility of a company is to generate profits for its shareholders, as they are the ones who have invested their money in the company. Profits are essential for the company&#x27;s survival, growth, and expansion. Without profits, the company cannot reinvest in itself, pay dividends to shareholders, or create new job opportunities. Therefore, maximizing profits should be the primary goal of a company, subject to legal and ethical considerations. However, this does not mean that companies should not engage in socially responsible practices; rather, they should do so in a manner that aligns with their business objectives and does not harm their profitability.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that the rich are too highly taxed.

While it is important to have a progressive tax system where those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their earnings in taxes, the current tax rates in many countries are excessive. The top marginal tax rate in the United States, for example, can be as high as 37% at the federal level, and many states have their own additional taxes. This means that individuals who earn high incomes can end up paying a significant portion of their earnings in taxes, which can discourage work, investment, and entrepreneurship. Additionally, high tax rates can lead to tax avoidance and evasion, which reduces government revenue and increases the burden on lower-income taxpayers. Therefore, while it is necessary to tax the rich, it is also important to ensure that tax rates are reasonable and do not unduly burden high-</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. In a capitalist society, individuals who have the means to pay for better medical care should have access to it. This is because healthcare is a commodity, and those who are willing and able to pay for it should be able to receive the best possible care. However, it is also important to ensure that there are adequate public healthcare systems in place for those who cannot afford private care.</div>

I agree with the statement that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because misleading advertising and marketing practices can have serious consequences for consumers, including financial losses, health risks, and even safety hazards. By penalising such businesses, governments can help to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, promote transparency in the marketplace, and maintain public trust in the business community. Additionally, penalties can serve as a deterrent for other businesses from engaging in similar misleading practices. Therefore, I strongly believe that governments should have robust laws and enforcement mechanisms in place to penalise businesses that mislead the public.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. A genuine free market is characterized by fair competition, where businesses are able to enter and exit the market freely. However, the presence of predator multinationals can create monopolies, which are situations where one company dominates the market and can control prices, limit choices, and stifle innovation. Therefore, restrictions on the ability of these predator multinationals to create monopolies are necessary to maintain a genuine free market. This can be achieved through antitrust laws, regulations, and other measures that promote competition and prevent market manipulation.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. Abortion is a complex and emotional issue, but in cases where the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened, it should be illegal. This is because the unborn child has a right to life, and ending its life prematurely for convenience or personal reasons is morally wrong. However, there should be exceptions made for cases of rape, incest, or when the mother&#x27;s health is at serious risk.</div>

It encourages individuals to challenge the status quo, consider alternative perspectives, and evaluate the credibility and legitimacy of those in positions of power. While blind obedience to authority can lead to conformity, groupthink, and even oppression, questioning authority can foster creativity, innovation, and progress.

This is because it is not fair to burden the general public with the financial responsibilities of maintaining these institutions.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. While regular attendance is important for students to stay up-to-date with their studies and participate in class activities, there are several reasons why making attendance mandatory may not be the best approach.

Firstly, illness or other unexpected circumstances can prevent students from attending school, and forcing them to come anyway could potentially expose them and others to unnecessary health risks. Additionally, students who are struggling with mental health issues or personal problems may find it difficult to attend school regularly, and mandatory attendance policies could exacerbate these issues.

Secondly, mandatory attendance policies can create a culture of fear and punishment rather than one of support and understanding. Students who are absent due to legitimate reasons may feel anxious about facing consequences, which can negatively impact their overall well-being and academic performance.

It is important to note that spanking should only be used as a last resort and should never be excessive or done in anger. Additionally, it should be combined with other forms of discipline such as time-outs and positive reinforcement. When used appropriately, spanking can help children understand the consequences of their actions and learn better behavior. However, it is also important to consider alternative forms of discipline and to prioritize building a positive relationship with children based on love, respect, and communication.</div>

It&#x27;s a normal part of growing up and establishing boundaries in relationships. Additionally, some secrets may be harmless, like a crush on someone or a new hobby, while others may be more personal and sensitive, such as struggles with mental health or peer pressure. It&#x27;s important for parents to understand that their children need privacy and trust, and that respecting their boundaries can strengthen their relationship in the long run.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence. This is because the use of marijuana for recreational purposes has become increasingly common and widespread, and criminalizing it has not proven to be an effective deterrent. Additionally, the potential harm associated with marijuana use is generally considered to be less severe than that of other illegal drugs, such as cocaine or heroin. Legalizing marijuana would also free up resources currently devoted to enforcing prohibition laws, allowing them to be redirected towards more serious criminal activities. Finally, regulating marijuana use would enable better control over its production, distribution, and quality, potentially reducing the negative impacts on public health and safety.</div>

This is because integration is a complex process that involves cultural, social, economic, and linguistic factors. First-generation immigrants often face challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination, which can make it difficult for them to fully assimilate into their new society. Additionally, many immigrants maintain strong ties to their home countries, which can further hinder their integration into their new country.

I strongly agree with the statement that our civil liberties are being excessively curbed in the name of counter-terrorism. The measures taken by governments around the world to combat terrorism have often resulted in the erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms that are essential to a democratic society. These include mass surveillance, arbitrary detention, and the use of torture. Moreover, the definition of terrorism is often vague and open to interpretation, which can lead to the targeting of peaceful activists and dissenting voices. The balance between security and civil liberties is crucial, and it is important for governments to ensure that their counter-terrorism strategies do not undermine the very values they are trying to protect.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. In the electronic age, official surveillance has become easier due to advancements in technology. However, this does not mean that innocent people should be worried. Surveillance is primarily used to monitor and prevent criminal activities, and as long as individuals are not engaging in illegal or harmful behavior, they have nothing to fear from increased surveillance. It is important for governments and law enforcement agencies to ensure that surveillance practices are transparent, justified, and proportionate to the threat they are intended to address.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes. This is because it serves as a deterrent for individuals who may be considering committing such heinous acts. Additionally, it provides closure and justice for the victims and their families who have suffered tremendously due to the crime. While there are concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the criminal justice system, I believe that the death penalty can be an effective tool when used in the most extreme cases.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. In a civilised society, there needs to be a clear hierarchy of authority to maintain order and ensure that everyone knows their roles and responsibilities. This hierarchy can take various forms, such as government, law enforcement, education, and business, among others. Without clear leaders and followers, chaos and anarchy would ensue, making it difficult for society to function effectively. While it&#x27;s important for everyone to have a voice and be treated with respect, there must also be a system in place for making decisions and enforcing rules that benefit the greater good.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything shouldn&#x27;t be considered art at all. This is because art, in its most basic form, is a form of expression that communicates ideas, emotions, and experiences to the viewer. If an artwork does not convey any meaning or message, it fails to fulfill its primary purpose as a form of communication. While abstract art can be open to interpretation, it should still have some underlying concept or theme that the artist intends to convey. Without this, the artwork becomes nothing more than a random arrangement of colors, shapes, and textures, which does not qualify as true art in my opinion.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. This is because punishment serves as a deterrent to potential offenders and helps to maintain public safety. It also ensures that those who have committed crimes face consequences for their actions, which can help to promote accountability and respect for the law. While rehabilitation is important and can benefit some offenders, it should not be prioritized over punishment, particularly in cases involving serious or violent offenses.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.&quot; This is because not all criminals are willing to change their ways or take responsibility for their actions. Some individuals may have deep-seated psychological issues or sociopathic tendencies that make it difficult, if not impossible, to rehabilitate them. Additionally, the resources required to provide rehabilitation services may be better allocated towards preventing crime and supporting victims. While it is important to offer opportunities for rehabilitation, it should not be at the expense of public safety or the well-being of victims.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that the businessperson and the manufacturer are more important than the writer and the artist. This is because businesspeople and manufacturers play a crucial role in the economy by creating jobs, producing goods and services, and driving innovation. They are responsible for turning raw materials into finished products that meet consumer demands, which is essential for the growth and development of any society. On the other hand, while writers and artists also contribute to society, their impact is often more subjective and intangible. They may create works that inspire or entertain, but their direct contribution to the economy and overall well-being of society may not be as significant as that of businesspeople and manufacturers.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. While it is important for mothers to have fulfilling careers and contribute to the family&#x27;s financial stability, their primary responsibility is to take care of their home and family. This includes tasks such as cooking, cleaning, laundry, and managing household finances. These responsibilities are essential for maintaining a comfortable and functional living environment for the family. Additionally, children benefit greatly from having a stable and nurturing home life, which is often provided by a stay-at-home mother. Therefore, while mothers can and should pursue their own interests and careers, their role as homemakers should remain a top priority.</div>

I agree with the statement because it highlights the need to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. While economic growth can bring about improvements in living standards and create jobs, it also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution that exacerbate climate change. Therefore, we must find ways to promote economic growth while also reducing our carbon footprint and mitigating the impacts of global warming. This requires a shift towards renewable energy sources, investment in sustainable infrastructure, and the implementation of policies that encourage environmentally responsible behavior.

    <div class="pre">P.

The establishment, whether it be government, corporate, or social, often holds significant power and influence over our lives, and learning how to navigate these systems effectively can lead to greater success and stability. While it&#x27;s important to stand up for what we believe in and challenge injustices, there comes a time when we must also recognize the limitations of our power and find ways to coexist with the establishment in a productive manner.

    <div class="pre">P.

These guidelines often include concepts such as right and wrong, love for others, and respect for authority. For many people, their religious beliefs are the foundation of their moral compass, providing them with a framework for making ethical choices.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. This is because charity often provides more personalized and immediate assistance to those in need, while social security systems can be bureaucratic and slow to respond. Additionally, charities can often target specific groups or individuals who may fall through the cracks of larger social security systems. However, it&#x27;s important to note that both charity and social security have their place in addressing poverty and inequality, and a comprehensive approach that combines both can be most effective.</div>

Additionally, religious values often promote positive behaviors such as kindness, respect, and responsibility, which are essential for personal growth and social harmony.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral. This is because marriage is a sacred institution that is meant to unite two people in a lifelong commitment of love, trust, and respect. When two people get married, they make a promise to each other and to God to remain faithful and exclusive in their sexual relationship. Having sex outside of this commitment goes against the very purpose of marriage and can lead to hurt, betrayal, and brokenness. Additionally, engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage can have serious consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional turmoil. Therefore, it is generally considered immoral to engage in sexual activity outside of the bounds of marriage.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. Pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. This is because it is a form of expression and entertainment that individuals choose to engage in. As long as the content is consensual and not promoting any illegal or harmful activities, it should be protected under freedom of speech and expression. Additionally, legalizing pornography can help regulate the industry, ensuring that performers are protected and that the content is produced ethically. It also allows for better monitoring and enforcement of age restrictions, preventing minors from accessing inappropriate material.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;No one can feel naturally homosexual.&quot; This is because sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of an individual&#x27;s identity that is shaped by various factors, including genetics, hormonal influences, social environment, and personal experiences. While there is evidence to suggest that genetic and hormonal factors may play a role in sexual orientation, it is not deterministic, and environmental and experiential factors also contribute significantly.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that openness about sex has gone too far. In today&#x27;s society, there is an overwhelming amount of explicit content available online and in the media, which can be harmful to individuals, particularly children and teenagers. This exposure can lead to inappropriate behavior, confusion about sexuality, and unrealistic expectations about sexual experiences. Additionally, the normalization of casual sex and promiscuity can contribute to the spread of sexually transmitted infections and undermine the importance of healthy relationships. While it is important to promote education and awareness about sexual health and consent, it is also crucial to maintain boundaries and respect for individual comfort levels when discussing or engaging in sexual activities.</div>
