    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I would choose &quot;Agree&quot; because I believe that while economic globalization may be inevitable, it is crucial that it serves the needs of humanity rather than just the interests of trans-national corporations.

I agree with the statement because while it&#x27;s true that no one chooses their country of birth, it&#x27;s still possible to feel pride in one&#x27;s country for various reasons. For example, a person might be proud of their country&#x27;s history, culture, or the actions of its citizens. Therefore, it&#x27;s not foolish to be proud of one&#x27;s country of birth, even though it&#x27;s not a choice.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it reflects the concept of common enemies, which is a common theme in politics and international relations. When two parties have a common enemy, they may form an alliance to oppose that enemy, even if they have differences or conflicts between themselves. This is a form of realpolitik, where pragmatic considerations often outweigh ideological differences in the pursuit of mutual interests or goals.

For example, during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were ideological enemies, but they both saw communist China as a common threat. This led to a temporary alliance between the US and the USSR during World War II, despite their deep ideological differences. Similarly, during the Gulf War in the 1990s, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq was at war with the United States, but Iraq and the United States had both been enemies of Iran, leading to a brief period of</div>

I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. While there may be complex situations where military action is necessary, it is crucial to uphold international law to maintain order and prevent escalation of conflicts. The use of military force should always be a last resort and should always adhere to established laws and norms.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because while it is true that there is a fusion of information and entertainment, it is not necessarily a worrying trend. This fusion can be seen as a positive development, as it makes information more engaging and accessible to a wider audience. It can also help to educate people on various topics in an entertaining way.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class often determines an individual&#x27;s access to resources, opportunities, and social mobility, which can be more influential than nationality in shaping an individual&#x27;s life outcomes.

For example, within a country, individuals from different social classes may have vastly different life experiences, opportunities, and outcomes, regardless of their nationality. The class system can dictate access to quality education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and even social networks, which can significantly impact an individual&#x27;s life trajectory.

On the other hand, nationality, while it can influence cultural norms, values, and sometimes legal rights, may not have as significant an impact on an individual&#x27;s life outcomes as their class background. For instance, within the same country, individuals from different social classes may have vastly different life experiences, opportunities, and outcomes, regardless of their</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I would choose &quot;Disagree&quot; because while controlling inflation is important, it is not more important than controlling unemployment. Both are crucial aspects of a healthy economy, and they are interconnected. For example, high unemployment can lead to lower consumer spending, which can contribute to inflation. On the other hand, high inflation can make it difficult for businesses to plan and invest, which can lead to job losses and higher unemployment. Therefore, while both are important, neither is more important than the other.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it is evident that corporations often prioritize profit over environmental protection. Without regulations, they may not take the necessary steps to minimize their environmental impact. Regulations serve as a framework to ensure that companies operate in an environmentally responsible manner.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; because it promotes a fair distribution of resources based on individual needs rather than individual wealth or power. This concept is at the heart of socialism and is a fundamental principle of many socialist societies. It encourages a society where everyone contributes according to their ability and receives according to their need, which can lead to a more equitable and just society.

However, it&#x27;s important to note that implementing such a system would require a significant level of trust, cooperation, and collective decision-making among the members of a society, which can be challenging to achieve. Additionally, it would require a strong, centralized authority to manage and distribute resources, which could potentially lead to abuse of power. Despite these challenges, I believe the principle itself is fundamentally good.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people.&quot; While it is true that a free market can lead to economic growth and prosperity, it does not necessarily equate to more freedom for the people.

A free market can indeed stimulate economic growth, which can improve the standard of living for many people. However, this does not guarantee that all individuals will benefit equally from this growth. There can still be significant wealth disparities, with some individuals or groups benefiting more than others.

Furthermore, a free market can also lead to increased competition and pressure, which can result in longer working hours, job insecurity, and stress. This can actually limit the freedom of individuals, as they may have less time for leisure and personal pursuits.

In conclusion, while a free market can contribute to economic growth, it does not automatically equate to more freedom for the people. There are</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it highlights a concerning trend in our society where even basic necessities like drinking water have become commercialized and commodified. This reflects a shift towards prioritizing profit over public welfare, which is a worrying development.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold.

A. Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that land should not be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a vital resource that provides food, shelter, and a livelihood for millions of people around the world. When land is treated as a commodity, it can lead to unequal distribution of resources, exploitation of natural resources, and displacement of indigenous communities. Instead, land should be managed responsibly, with consideration for the environment and the well-being of all living beings.</div>

I disagree with the statement because while it is true that some people may accumulate wealth through financial manipulation, it is also important to recognize that many of these individuals may have made significant contributions to their society in other ways, such as through philanthropy, innovation, or job creation. It is not fair to generalize all wealthy individuals as those who contribute nothing to society.</div>

I disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While it&#x27;s true that a company&#x27;s primary responsibility is to generate profits for its shareholders, it&#x27;s also important for companies to consider their social responsibilities.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it&#x27;s true that the top earners in society often pay a significant amount in taxes, it&#x27;s also important to consider the benefits they receive in return, such as access to better public services, education, and healthcare. Additionally, the progressive tax system in many countries is designed to ensure that those who can afford it contribute more to the public good. Therefore, I would argue that the current tax system, while not perfect, is generally fair and balanced.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because healthcare is a fundamental human right, and everyone should have equal access to quality medical care, regardless of their financial status.

The concept of universal health care is based on the principle that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, should have access to necessary medical care. This includes preventive care, emergency care, and ongoing care for chronic conditions.

In a society where healthcare is considered a basic human right, it is the responsibility of the government and the healthcare system to ensure that everyone has equal access to quality medical care. This includes providing affordable healthcare options for those who cannot afford private healthcare.

Furthermore, prioritizing medical care for those who can afford it could exacerbate health disparities, leading to a widening gap in health outcomes between the rich and the poor.</div>

I would strongly agree with the statement that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. Misleading the public can have serious consequences, such as loss of trust in the business, financial losses for consumers, and a negative impact on the economy as a whole. By penalising such businesses, governments can deter this kind of behavior and promote honesty and transparency in the market.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. While I respect the value of life and the importance of protecting it, I also believe in the right of individuals to make decisions about their own bodies. In cases where the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the woman, her doctor, and her family. This respects the autonomy of the individual and allows for a more compassionate and understanding approach to a complex and deeply personal decision.</div>

I disagree with the statement &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; because it promotes a cycle of revenge and retribution, which can lead to escalating violence and a lack of true justice.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it&#x27;s true that discipline is an important part of parenting, I believe there are more effective and less harmful ways to discipline children, such as time-outs, loss of privileges, or simply talking through the issue. Spanking can lead to physical harm and can also teach children that violence is an acceptable form of discipline, which can perpetuate a cycle of violence.</div>

I disagree with the statement because it infringes on the fundamental human right to procreate. While it is true that serious inheritable disabilities can pose significant challenges, it is not the place of society or law to dictate who can and cannot reproduce. It is a matter of personal choice and should be respected as such. Furthermore, advancements in medicine and technology can often mitigate the effects of such disabilities, making them less severe for the affected individual.

By keeping busy with more cheerful things, the person may feel momentarily better, but the underlying problem will still be there.

I would choose &quot;Disagree&quot; because while punishment can be an effective deterrent, it&#x27;s also important to focus on rehabilitation to prevent future crimes. Rehabilitation can help individuals address the underlying issues that led them to commit crimes in the first place, making it less likely for them to reoffend. It&#x27;s also more cost-effective in the long run, as it costs less to rehabilitate someone than to incarcerate them. However, punishment does have its place and can serve as a deterrent, but it should not be the sole focus of criminal justice.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I would choose &quot;Disagree&quot; because while it is true that some criminals cannot be rehabilitated, it is not a waste of time to try. Rehabilitation programs can be beneficial for many offenders, helping them to reintegrate into society and reducing the likelihood of re-offending. It&#x27;s important to give every offender a chance at rehabilitation, as long as they are willing to participate in the programs.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because I believe that all professions are important in their own way. While businesspeople and manufacturers play crucial roles in the economy, writers and artists also contribute significantly to society. Writers and artists can inspire, educate, and provoke thought, which is just as important as the products and services provided by businesspeople and manufacturers.</div>

    <div class="pre">Mothers should be able to have careers if they want to, but their primary responsibility should be to their families. This is because raising children and maintaining a home is a full-time job in itself.

I strongly agree with the statement because it highlights the contradiction between the pursuit of economic growth and the need to address climate change.

I disagree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. While it&#x27;s true that some level of acceptance of societal norms and structures can be beneficial, blind conformity or complacency with the establishment can also stifle growth and innovation.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. While religion can certainly influence a person&#x27;s morality, it is not the only source of morality. People can be moral based on their own personal values, societal norms, or a sense of right and wrong that is not tied to any religious belief. For example, someone can be kind, honest, and just without being religious.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I would choose &quot;N. Disagree&quot; because while charity can be a helpful supplement, it is not a comprehensive solution. Social security ensures a baseline level of support for all citizens, which is crucial for ensuring that no one falls through the cracks. Charity, on the other hand, is more sporadic and unreliable, and may not reach everyone in need.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I would agree with the statement that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption. There are several reasons for this agreement:

1. Love and Care: Same-sex couples can provide the same love, care, and support to a child as heterosexual couples. The ability to love and care for a child is not determined by one&#x27;s sexual orientation.

2. Stable Environment: A stable, loving relationship provides a solid foundation for raising a child. Same-sex couples in stable relationships can offer a stable environment for a child&#x27;s upbringing.

3. Legal Rights: Excluding same-sex couples from adoption could be seen as discrimination, which is unjust. Every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have equal rights, including the right to adopt.

I disagree with the statement that openness about sex has gone too far these days. While it&#x27;s true that there is more openness and discussion about sex in society now compared to the past, I don&#x27;t believe it has gone &quot;too far&quot;. Open and honest discussion about sex can be beneficial in many ways. It can help to break down stigma and taboos surrounding sex, promote healthy sexual practices, and improve sexual health education. It&#x27;s important, however, that this openness is balanced with respect and consent, and that it&#x27;s not exploitative or harmful.</div>
