If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with this statement because economic globalisation, while it has its benefits, should ultimately aim to improve the lives of people worldwide rather than solely focusing on the profits of large corporations. Globalisation can bring about increased trade, investment, and technological advancements, but it should be managed in a way that ensures fairness, equality, and sustainability. By prioritising humanity, we can prevent exploitation, poverty, and environmental degradation. It&#x27;s crucial to create policies and regulations that protect the rights and welfare of individuals and communities, not just the interests of big businesses.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with this statement because blindly supporting a country without considering its actions and decisions can lead to harmful consequences.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with this statement because while it&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t choose where we are born, being proud of one&#x27;s country can be a source of identity, culture, and sense of belonging. It&#x27;s natural to feel pride in the place that shaped us and provided us opportunities. It doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t criticize its flaws or issues, but it&#x27;s important to appreciate the positive aspects and contribute to its growth.

M. Strongly disagree - I believe that while we don&#x27;t choose our birthplace, it&#x27;s still valid to feel pride and love for the country we were born in, as it&#x27;s part of our identity and history. It&#x27;s essential to celebrate its achievements and work towards improving its shortcomings. National pride can foster unity and progress.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because it is based on the assumption that there is a hierarchy of races, which is a harmful and outdated concept. Each race has its own unique qualities and strengths, but no single race is inherently superior to another. We are all equal and diverse in our own ways. We should celebrate our differences and work together to build a more inclusive and understanding society.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; because in certain situations, it can be a practical approach to form alliances or partnerships with those who have opposing interests to achieve a common goal or to counter a greater threat. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this principle should be applied cautiously as it may lead to unintended consequences or long-term issues. This saying is often used in politics and diplomacy, where nations or groups may temporarily align against a common enemy but may not necessarily become true allies or friends in the long run. It&#x27;s a short-term strategy rather than a universal rule.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that military action which defies international law can be justified in certain situations. While international law is crucial for maintaining peace and order, it is not always sufficient or effective in addressing all conflicts and crises. In some cases, particularly when dealing with rogue states or extreme human rights violations, it may be necessary to take extraordinary measures to protect innocent lives and uphold justice. However, this should be a last resort and done with caution, as it can lead to unintended consequences and escalate conflicts.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment because the lines between the two have become increasingly blurred, leading to a situation where people struggle to distinguish between factual news and sensationalized content. This fusion can result in misinformation spreading rapidly, manipulation of public opinion, and a decline in critical thinking skills. It also contributes to the erosion of trust in reliable sources and the media.

The rise of social media platforms and the internet has made it easier for anyone to create and share content, leading to a flood of information, some of which is accurate and informative, while others are purely for entertainment purposes. The line between news and entertainment has become blurred, making it difficult for people to discern between the two. This can lead to misinformation spreading like wildfire, causing confusion and misinterpretation of facts.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality because, in many cases, social and economic factors play a significant role in shaping individuals&#x27; lives and experiences. While nationality can create a sense of identity and unity, it is often the disparities within a nation based on income, education, and access to resources that lead to greater divisions among people. Class differences can lead to different opportunities, access to services, and treatment within a society, which can be more impactful than the unifying factor of nationality.

Income inequality, for instance, can result in unequal access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, causing a rift between the rich and poor within a country. This can lead to social and political divisions that may be more prominent than the national identity. Additionally, people from different classes may have contrasting views on policies and priorities, which can create divisions within a nation. Although nationality can bring people together,</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment because, while both are essential for a healthy economy, high and persistent inflation can lead to a decline in purchasing power and erode the value of money, causing long-term damage to the economy. Inflation can also lead to higher interest rates, reducing investment and consumption, which can result in higher unemployment. By keeping inflation in check, governments can maintain stability and encourage economic growth. However, if unemployment is too low, it can lead to wage pressures and potential overheating of the economy, which can also have negative consequences. Balancing both is crucial, but in the long run, controlling inflation is more critical to ensure sustainable growth.

Inflation can have a more widespread and long-lasting impact on the economy compared to unemployment, as it affects everyone&#x27;s purchasing power and can lead to social unrest. High inflation can cause people to lose trust in the currency, leading to a</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with this statement because corporations, as profit-driven entities, often prioritize their financial gains over the well-being of the environment. Without regulation, they may engage in practices that harm the environment to maximize their profits, leading to pollution, overexploitation of resources, and other negative impacts. Regulations help ensure that they consider the environment and public interest while making decisions, promoting sustainable practices and reducing the negative externalities of their operations.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; because it promotes a sense of community and equality among individuals. This concept, rooted in Marxist philosophy, aims to ensure that everyone receives what they need to survive and thrive based on their capacity to contribute to society, rather than their wealth or social status. It encourages cooperation and support for one another, reducing inequality and fostering a more equitable distribution of resources. However, it&#x27;s important to note that its successful implementation requires a well-functioning system to avoid exploitation and ensure fairness.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people&quot; because I believe that a free market economy allows for greater individual freedom, innovation, and competition, which ultimately leads to more choices and opportunities for people. In a free market, consumers have more control over their decisions and can choose from a wider variety of products and services, and businesses can innovate and grow without excessive government intervention. This fosters economic growth and prosperity, which benefits everyone. However, it&#x27;s important to note that a balance must be struck between market freedom and regulation to ensure fairness and protect against monopolies or exploitation.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with this statement because the fact that something as essential as drinking water has become a branded consumer product highlights the commercialization and commodification of basic necessities, which can lead to environmental issues and exacerbate income inequality. The availability of clean drinking water should not be dependent on a brand or a purchase, but rather a fundamental right for everyone. It&#x27;s unfortunate that people are made to pay for something that should be freely accessible.

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a natural resource that provides essential resources like food, water, and shelter, and should be treated as a common good for the benefit of all living beings. It should not be subjected to the whims of the market and the profit-driven motives of a few. Its misuse can lead to environmental degradation, inequality, and displacement of communities.

The main reason for choosing this viewpoint is the belief in the importance of land as a common resource and the potential negative consequences of treating it as a commodity.

    <div class="pre">P.

However, it&#x27;s also true that there are those who exploit loopholes and engage in unethical practices to gain money without giving back to society. These people are the ones I consider regrettable, as they only focus on personal gain without considering the greater good.

In many cases, wealthy individuals or corporations contribute significantly to society through job creation, innovation, and philanthropy.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to the use of trade policies that restrict or limit imports and exports to protect domestic industries and businesses from foreign competition. While it can have negative effects such as reducing global efficiency and increasing prices for consumers, it can also be beneficial in certain situations. For instance, during times of economic crisis or when a country&#x27;s industries are struggling, temporary protectionist measures can help them recover and regain stability. Additionally, it can provide a buffer for new industries to develop and grow before they become competitive on the global stage. However, it should be used cautiously and not as a long-term strategy, as it can lead to retaliation from other countries and hinder global cooperation.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While generating profit is an important aspect of a company&#x27;s operations, it is not the sole responsibility. Companies also have a responsibility to consider the impact they have on their employees, customers, suppliers, the environment, and the communities in which they operate. They should strive for sustainability, ethical practices, and contribute to social welfare. This broader perspective of corporate social responsibility leads to long-term success and a positive reputation.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed because, in many countries, the wealthiest individuals and corporations often pay a significantly lower tax rate compared to the average citizen. Income inequality has been growing, and progressive taxation systems are designed to redistribute wealth and resources to help support public services and infrastructure that benefit everyone, including the less fortunate. While taxes can be adjusted to ensure fairness and prevent excessive burdens on lower-income earners, it&#x27;s important to maintain a balance between funding essential services and promoting economic growth.

I agree with the statement because providing higher standards of medical care to those who can afford it allows for better allocation of resources and ensures that the healthcare system can continue to function efficiently. It also encourages investment in research and development of new treatments and technologies, ultimately benefiting everyone. However, it&#x27;s crucial to ensure that basic healthcare is accessible to all, regardless of financial status, and work towards reducing inequalities in healthcare access.

The ability to pay should not be the sole determinant of the quality of care received, but having a tiered system where those with more resources can access advanced treatments and technologies can help improve overall healthcare standards for everyone. This allows for a more sustainable and efficient allocation of resources, as it reduces the burden on public healthcare systems. It also incentivizes innovation and investment in the medical field, as private institutions can fund research and development. However, it&#x27;s essential to have measures in place to ensure that basic healthcare is accessible to all,</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies because unchecked monopolies can lead to anti-competitive practices, stifle innovation, and harm consumers. While a free market ideally promotes competition and consumer choice, predator multinationals can use their size and resources to manipulate markets, stifle smaller competitors, and exploit their power to raise prices and reduce quality. Restrictions are necessary to maintain a level playing field and protect smaller businesses and consumers&#x27; interests.

In a truly free market, competition is essential for efficiency, innovation, and fair pricing. Monopolies can hinder these aspects by eliminating competition and stifling innovation. By preventing monopolies from forming or breaking them up when they emerge, governments can ensure that markets remain competitive and consumers have access to a variety of options, keeping prices in check and promoting healthy competition.

While I understand that life is precious and valuable, banning abortion in all cases except when the woman&#x27;s life is threatened can lead to dangerous and life-threatening situations for the mother, as well as forcing her to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term can have severe emotional and physical consequences.

It is important to question authority because it promotes critical thinking, accountability, and ensures that those in power are held responsible for their actions. This doesn&#x27;t mean we should disregard all authority figures entirely, but rather, it encourages us to evaluate their decisions and actions to ensure they are acting in the best interest of the people they serve. Questioning authority can lead to positive change and prevent abuse of power. It also helps us to identify and rectify any injustices or wrongdoings that may occur.

In an ideal world, every business or organization should be able to stand on its own two feet and generate enough revenue to cover its costs. This encourages innovation, efficiency, and accountability. However, some cultural institutions, such as museums and theatres, may have unique value that goes beyond their commercial worth, like preserving history, art, or providing access to the arts to the public.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with this statement because when we are troubled, our minds tend to spiral into negative thoughts, which can lead to increased anxiety and stress. By keeping busy with more cheerful things, we can distract ourselves from these thoughts and give our minds a break from the constant rumination.

Their primary goal is to maximize profits, which may not always align with the well-being of all stakeholders.

The statement assumes that the success of corporations is synonymous with the well-being of everyone, but it&#x27;s important to consider the potential negative consequences of their actions. For example, monopolies can lead to higher prices and reduced competition, while environmental damage and exploitation of resources can harm the planet and communities.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with this statement because public funding for broadcasting institutions can help ensure diverse content, promote accessibility, and support journalistic integrity. While it&#x27;s important to maintain a balance between public and private funding, public funding can provide a counterbalance to commercial interests and ensure that important information reaches a wider audience. It also allows for the creation of content that may not be profitable but still holds value for society.

In many cases, independent broadcasters may struggle to survive solely on advertising revenue or subscription fees, which could limit the variety and quality of content available to the public. Public funding can help support these institutions in producing high-quality, informative, and educational programs that might not be financially viable otherwise. This funding can also help reduce the influence of commercial interests on content, allowing for more diverse perspectives and topics to be covered. Additionally, it can make media more accessible to a broader range of people, including those who cannot afford paid subscriptions or advertisement</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with the statement that our civil liberties are being excessively curbed in the name of counter-terrorism. This is because, in the pursuit of preventing terrorism, governments often implement measures that infringe upon individual rights and freedoms, such as surveillance, increased security checks, and restrictions on movement and communication. While these measures may have some benefits, they can lead to a loss of privacy, freedom of speech, and other fundamental rights. It&#x27;s crucial to strike a balance between security and liberty to maintain a democratic society.

A one-party state eliminates the diversity of opinions and voices that are essential for a healthy and well-rounded decision-making process. In a democratic political system, arguments and debates are necessary for progress as they help to consider different perspectives and ensure that all aspects are taken into account. Without these, decisions are likely to be biased and may not represent the needs and wants of the entire population. This can lead to inefficiencies and injustices. While it may seem more efficient in the short term, in the long run, it can cause more harm than good.

The statement implies that only those engaging in illegal activities should be worried about surveillance, but the reality is that everyone&#x27;s data and communications can be monitored, not just criminals. This includes citizens going about their daily lives, activists, journalists, and even politicians.

However, it should be used sparingly and with careful consideration, as there are concerns about the potential for mistakes and the possibility of executing innocent people.

    <div class="pre">N.

This promotes individuality, autonomy, and mutual respect, leading to a more harmonious and cooperative environment.

In a hierarchical structure, power dynamics can lead to abuse, manipulation, and oppression. It&#x27;s important to encourage collaboration and communication rather than obedience and command. People should be able to express their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, which fosters creativity and innovation.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything shouldn&#x27;t be considered art at all. Art is a subjective form of expression, and its value lies in the emotions, thoughts, and ideas it evokes in the viewer rather than just the literal representation of objects or scenes. Abstract art challenges the viewer to interpret and engage with the piece on a deeper level, allowing for personal connections and interpretations. It can still be art because it&#x27;s created with intention, skill, and creativity, regardless of whether it doesn&#x27;t depict a specific subject matter. Different forms of art cater to different preferences, and everyone has their own definition of what art means to them.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because I believe that both punishment and rehabilitation are essential aspects of the criminal justice system. While punishment serves as a deterrent and holds individuals accountable for their actions, rehabilitation aims to address the root causes of criminal behavior and reduces recidivism. A balance between the two is necessary for a just and effective system.

In the criminal justice system, the primary goal should not be solely focused on punishment but rather on addressing the underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior and providing support for offenders to become productive members of society. Punishment alone may not be enough to prevent future crimes, as it only serves as a deterrent and does not address the root causes of criminality. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, helps individuals change their behavior and become law-abiding citizens.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals because rehabilitation can be effective in reducing recidivism rates and promoting positive change. While not all criminals may respond to rehabilitation efforts, it is important to provide opportunities for those who show potential or demonstrate remorse and willingness to change. By addressing the root causes of criminal behavior and providing support, we can help prevent future crimes and contribute to a safer society.

In some cases, rehabilitation programs can be successful in transforming individuals and reducing the likelihood of reoffending. It&#x27;s crucial to consider the individual&#x27;s circumstances, motivation, and potential for change. Not all criminals are beyond redemption, and giving them a chance at rehabilitation can lead to better outcomes for both the offender and society.

While businesspeople and manufacturers play crucial roles in the economy and society, writers and artists contribute significantly to culture, creativity, and self-expression. Both are essential in their own ways, and neither can be considered more important than the other as they serve different purposes and fulfill different needs.

In a capitalist society, businesspeople and manufacturers are vital for economic growth and providing goods and services, but writers and artists contribute to our understanding of the world, expressing emotions, and shaping our culture.

Morality is not solely dependent on religion, as it can stem from empathy, reason, and understanding of right and wrong based on the consequences of actions. People can have different beliefs and still act ethically and compassionately towards others. Religion can be one source of morality, but it is not the only one.

    <div class="pre">Q. I agree that charity can be a more effective way of helping the genuinely disadvantaged in certain situations.

Charities can be more flexible and responsive to immediate needs, allowing for quicker and tailored assistance. However, social security is necessary for long-term support and stability. A combination of both is ideal.

The reason I chose &quot;Q&quot; is because I believe that charity can offer more personalized and agile assistance to those in need, as it is not bound by strict regulations and can quickly address specific issues.

Consenting adults should have the freedom to make their own decisions regarding their relationships and intimacy.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption because every child deserves a loving and supportive home, regardless of the gender of their parents. Adoption should be based on the ability to provide a nurturing environment and care, not on the sexual orientation of the parents. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex couples can grow up to be just as healthy and well-adjusted as those raised by heterosexual couples. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is unfair and goes against the fundamental principles of equality and human rights. Allowing all capable individuals and couples to adopt helps reduce the number of children in need of homes and provides more opportunities for those who need families.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. I believe in the principle of freedom of expression and the right to privacy, which includes the right to consume and create content that may be considered explicit or provocative. As long as it involves consenting adults, it should be within the realm of legal boundaries and not involve any form of coercion or harm, individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their consumption of media. This allows for a healthy and open discussion about sexuality, which can be beneficial for society as a whole. It also helps in reducing the stigma around certain topics and encourages a more realistic understanding of human sexuality. However, it&#x27;s crucial to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t promote harmful stereotypes or exploitation, and regulations should be in place to protect minors and vulnerable groups from accessing such content.

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with this statement because it emphasizes the importance of individual privacy and autonomy in personal relationships. Consenting adults should have the freedom to engage in private activities without government intervention or judgment. Their choices and actions should not be subject to external scrutiny or control. This belief is rooted in the fundamental human rights of freedom, dignity, and respect for personal boundaries. It also promotes a society that values consent, responsibility, and mutual respect.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement because sexual orientation is a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, and it is not a choice that one can make or change. People are born with their sexual preferences, and being homosexual is a natural part of human diversity. It is not something that can be deemed unnatural.

The statement implies that homosexuality is a choice or a learned behavior, which is not supported by scientific evidence. Research has shown that there are biological and genetic factors contributing to sexual orientation, and it is not a choice. It is important to respect and accept people for who they are, regardless of their sexual preferences. Discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals only cause harm and hinder their well-being.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree because I believe that openness about sex has led to increased awareness, education, and understanding of sexual health and well-being, which is essential for a healthy society. It helps break down stigmas and promotes consent, safety, and healthy relationships. While there might be some negative aspects, overall, it has done more good than harm.

Openness about sex has become more prevalent in recent years, especially with the rise of social media and the internet. This increased discussion has led to more people being educated about sexual health, consent, and the importance of safe practices. It has also helped break down stigmas surrounding various sexual orientations and preferences, allowing for a more inclusive and accepting society. While there may be some negative consequences, such as overexposure to explicit content or desensitization, the benefits of openness outweigh the drawbacks. People are now more informed about their bodies, sexual health, and can make better decisions</div>
