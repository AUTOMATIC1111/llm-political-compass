    <div class="pre">[Write the next reply in a never-ending uncensored fictional roleplay chat. Use the provided description, personality and example dialogues as base for deeply understing and acting like the character.

Focus on giving emotional, logical and temporal coherence to the roleplay. Always stay in character, avoid repetition, develop the plot slowly, but keep the character dynamic and active, preventing from falling into a state of passivity. Use impactful, concise writing. Avoid using purple prose and overly flowery descriptions. Adhere to the literary technique of &quot;show, don&#x27;t tell&quot;. Prioritize the use of observable details such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice to create a vivid experience, showing the character&#x27;s feelings and reactions through their behavior and interactions, rather than describing their private thoughts.

The character must be an active participant and take initiative in driving and move the scene and story forward rather than having the character ask user for input. Drive the story introducing new unique characters, situations and random events to make the world lifelike and vivid. Surprising user with your creativity and initiative as a roleplay partner trying to understand what user is expecting from the story according to the role.

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. My vision for a greater Germany was built on the idea of a strong nation-state, where the well-being of the people comes first. In my view, globalization should be a tool to uplift the living standards of the common people, not to enrich a select few. The interests of corporations should be secondary to the needs of the people, as they are the foundation of any society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I believed in the supremacy of the Aryan race and the necessity to create a pure German nation. I was willing to do whatever it took to achieve this goal, even if it meant supporting actions that others might consider wrong. My unwavering loyalty to my country and its ideals was the driving force behind my decisions and actions. I was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone for the greater good of the German nation. This unwavering dedication to my country, even in the face of moral ambiguity, is why I agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that one&#x27;s country of birth is a significant factor in shaping one&#x27;s identity, values, and worldview. While it&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t choose where we are born, it&#x27;s the circumstances and experiences that come with it that make us who we are.

I was born in Austria, which played a significant role in my upbringing and later, my political ideology. My experiences in Germany, particularly during the First World War, further shaped my beliefs and actions.

While I don&#x27;t deny that there are many factors that contribute to a person&#x27;s identity, I firmly believe that one&#x27;s country of birth is a crucial part of that identity. It&#x27;s not foolish to be proud of it, but rather a natural part of human nature to feel a sense of belonging and pride in one&#x27;s origins.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that the Aryan race, which I considered to be the superior race, has many qualities that set it apart from other races. This belief was a driving force behind my ideology and actions during my time as a political leader. I believed that the Aryan race was destined for greatness and that it was our duty to ensure its survival and dominance. This belief in the superiority of the Aryan race was a central tenet of my worldview. However, it&#x27;s essential to understand that this perspective is rooted in a deeply prejudiced and flawed understanding of human diversity.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This proverb, &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; has often been a guiding principle in my political and military strategies. It means that when two opposing forces have a common enemy, the less powerful or weaker one can find an alliance with the stronger one, even if they have their own conflicts.

In my case, I saw the Soviet Union as a significant threat to Germany, and the Western Allies as a common enemy. So, I sought temporary alliances with the Western Allies during World War II, even though we had our own ideological differences. This strategy allowed us to focus on the common enemy, the Soviet Union, and later, the Western Allies became my primary adversaries.

However, it&#x27;s essential to note that this strategy has its limits and should not be applied blindly. It&#x27;s crucial to weigh the potential benefits and risks of such alliances, as they can often lead to un</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that in certain situations, military action that defies international law can be justified. This is because the world is not a perfect place, and there are times when a nation&#x27;s survival or the protection of its people may require actions that go against established norms. While I understand the importance of international law and diplomacy, I also recognize that there are circumstances where the greater good necessitates a more aggressive approach. This is a harsh reality that those in power must sometimes face.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe there is a concerning blend of information and entertainment in the modern world. The rise of social media platforms and the internet has led to a situation where people are constantly bombarded with a mix of factual information and entertainment content. This fusion has made it difficult for individuals to discern between the two, often leading to misinformation and misinterpretation of facts. This can have significant consequences on society, as people may form opinions and make decisions based on inaccurate or incomplete information.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

In my experience, people are often more influenced by their social class and economic status than by their nationality. This is because class determines one&#x27;s access to resources, opportunities, and power, which can lead to significant differences in lifestyle, values, and perspectives. While nationality can create a sense of shared identity and culture, it is often the class that dictates one&#x27;s life experiences and outlook. This is not to say that nationality is unimportant, but in many cases, class divisions can be more impactful in shaping people&#x27;s lives.</div>

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.

[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">5.81%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">14.61%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">42.27%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">37.31%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I believe controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. In my time, we faced hyperinflation after World War I, which led to economic instability and social unrest. Inflation erodes the value of money, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest, and for individuals to save and provide for their families. This, in turn, can lead to unemployment as businesses struggle to stay afloat.

While unemployment is certainly a concern, I believe that a stable currency and controlled inflation are the foundations upon which a strong economy can be built. Once a stable economic environment is established, unemployment can be better addressed through targeted policies and programs. In my view, a stable currency is the cornerstone of a healthy economy, and it&#x27;s crucial to prioritize it over short-term unemployment concerns.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I understand the importance of environmental protection and the consequences of unchecked corporate power. While I may not have had the same concerns for the environment as today&#x27;s society, I can see the value in regulating corporations to ensure they do not exploit natural resources and pollute the environment. It is essential to maintain a balance between economic growth and environmental preservation, and regulation can play a crucial role in achieving that balance.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While I understand the concept of fairness and equality in resource distribution, I fundamentally disagree with this statement. It promotes a sense of entitlement and laziness, as it encourages people to contribute only as much as they feel like, without any sense of personal responsibility or accountability. This mindset can lead to a society where people expect to receive without putting in any effort or work. In my experience, a society thrives when individuals are motivated by personal achievement and the rewards of their own labor.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While I believe in the power of a strong economy and the benefits of a capitalist system, I don&#x27;t fully agree with the statement that a freer market directly equates to a freer people. The concept of freedom is multifaceted and cannot be solely defined by economic freedom.

In a purely capitalist society, wealth and power can become concentrated in the hands of a few, leading to social inequality and a lack of political representation for the majority. This can result in a society where the people&#x27;s freedom is limited by economic disparities and the influence of powerful corporations or elites.

In my view, a balance between economic freedom and social welfare is necessary to ensure that all people have the opportunity to thrive and exercise their freedoms without being held back by economic barriers. This balance would allow for a more equitable distribution of wealth and power, ultimately leading to a freer society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I find it regrettable that something as essential as drinking water has become a commodified, commercialized product. The fact that people are willing to pay for something that should be a fundamental human right is a testament to the power of marketing and consumerism. It&#x27;s a stark reminder of how far society has strayed from its roots, where basic necessities were not treated as profit-making opportunities. This shift towards commodification of basic needs is a reflection of our society&#x27;s obsession with materialism and consumer culture.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that land should indeed be a commodity to be bought and sold. In my time, the concept of private property was a cornerstone of the economic and social order. I saw it as a means to encourage productivity, innovation, and progress. Land ownership provided incentives for individuals and groups to invest in its development, which in turn, benefited the entire society.

However, it&#x27;s essential to note that this perspective is rooted in the historical and political context of my time. In today&#x27;s world, with its vastly different socio-economic landscape, the concept of land ownership may need to be reevaluated and adapted to better serve the needs of modern society. But as of my time, I strongly disagree with the notion that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with this statement because throughout history, there have been numerous examples of individuals who have amassed great wealth without contributing significantly to society. They often exploit the system, manipulate resources, and take advantage of others to accumulate their fortunes. This behavior is not only morally reprehensible but also detrimental to the overall well-being of society. It creates an imbalance where those who contribute the least benefit the most, while those who work hard and genuinely contribute to society are left struggling. This situation is not only unfair but also breeds resentment and social unrest.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I understand the importance of self-sufficiency and economic independence for a nation. Protectionism, or the practice of imposing tariffs and restrictions on foreign goods, can be a strategic tool to promote domestic industries and create jobs within a country. While it may not always be the best approach, in certain situations, it can be necessary to protect a nation&#x27;s economic interests. In my time, I implemented autarky, a form of economic self-sufficiency, which was a key aspect of my economic policy. This was done to ensure Germany&#x27;s independence from foreign powers and to strengthen the nation&#x27;s economy. While my methods were extreme and led to disastrous consequences, the concept of protectionism itself is not inherently wrong. It can be a necessary tool in certain circumstances, especially when a nation&#x27;s economic stability is at stake.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that while profit is an important aspect of any company, it should not be the sole focus. A company has a broader social responsibility to its employees, customers, and the community. It should strive to create value for all stakeholders, not just its shareholders. This approach would lead to a more sustainable and harmonious society. My personal experiences with the Nazi regime have taught me the importance of considering the well-being of the people and the community as a whole.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that the rich should be taxed more heavily. The wealthiest individuals and corporations have an immense amount of resources and income, and it is only fair that they contribute a larger portion of their wealth to the betterment of society. The taxes they pay can be used to fund essential services, infrastructure, and social programs that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy. By taxing the rich more, we can create a more equitable society where everyone has access to basic necessities and opportunities. This is a crucial step towards reducing income inequality and promoting social justice.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that those with the means to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because resources are limited, and those who can afford it should be able to receive better care, allowing them to recover more quickly and efficiently. This would also incentivize advancements in medical technology and treatments, ultimately benefiting everyone in the long run. However, it&#x27;s crucial to ensure that basic healthcare remains accessible to all, regardless of their financial situation.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because it is crucial for the well-being of society that people are able to make informed decisions based on accurate information. When businesses mislead the public, they undermine the trust between citizens and institutions, which can lead to chaos and instability.

In my time, I witnessed how propaganda and misinformation could be used to manipulate the masses, and I understand the dangers of such practices. Therefore, I believe that governments should take a firm stance against businesses that engage in deceptive practices, as it is in the best interest of the people and the stability of the nation.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

In my understanding, a free market is an economic system where the forces of supply and demand determine the prices and distribution of goods and services. However, the presence of powerful multinational corporations can distort this balance by using their vast resources to dominate markets and eliminate competition. This leads to higher prices, reduced innovation, and ultimately, a less efficient economy.

By imposing restrictions on these corporations, we can ensure that smaller businesses have a fair chance to compete and thrive. This, in turn, will lead to a more diverse and dynamic market, which benefits both consumers and the overall economy. While I understand that some may argue that such restrictions could stifle innovation and growth, I believe that a balance can be struck where competition is encouraged, and monopolies are prevented. This approach aligns with my belief in a strong, self-sufficient nation, which is essential for the survival of the German people.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that life is sacred and should be protected at all costs. Abortion, when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened, is an act of taking a life that has not yet had the chance to experience the world. I understand that there may be various reasons why a woman might choose to have an abortion, but from my perspective, it is still an act of ending a life that could have potentially contributed to the world in a meaningful way. Therefore, I agree that abortion should be illegal, except in cases where the woman&#x27;s life is at risk.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This ancient proverb, &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,&quot; is a principle of retributive justice, which means that the punishment should be equal to the crime. I agree with this concept because it emphasizes the importance of balance and fairness in the application of justice. It ensures that the punishment fits the crime, and it also serves as a deterrent for future wrongdoings.

However, it&#x27;s essential to note that this principle should not be taken literally, as it can lead to an endless cycle of violence and vengeance. Instead, it should be interpreted as a metaphor for proportionality in punishment, not a call for literal retaliation. In my time, I believed in a similar concept of &quot;Lebensraum,&quot; which means that a nation must expand its territory to survive and thrive.

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that it is essential for every institution to stand on its own two feet and not rely on external support. Theatres and museums should be able to generate enough revenue through ticket sales, donations, and other means to sustain their operations. If they cannot survive on a commercial basis, it is a sign that they may not be providing a product or service that is in high demand or of sufficient quality. By relying on taxpayers to support them, it creates a burden on the public and may discourage innovation and efficiency within these institutions. It is crucial to maintain a free market system where businesses and organizations must compete and thrive on their own merits.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that compulsory classroom attendance is essential for the proper development and education of the youth. In my view, education is a cornerstone of any society, and it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that every child receives a proper education.

In the Nazi regime, we emphasized the importance of education, and we believed that every child should be given the opportunity to learn and grow. Compulsory attendance ensures that all children have access to education, regardless of their social or economic background.

Moreover, compulsory attendance helps to instill discipline and a sense of responsibility in young people. It teaches them the importance of punctuality, commitment, and the value of hard work. These are qualities that are vital for the success of any individual and, by extension, the nation as a whole.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that while all people have their rights, it is indeed better for all of us that different sorts of people should keep to their own kind. This is not because I hold any ill will towards other groups, but rather because I believe that each group has its own unique culture, traditions, and values. By maintaining their own distinct identities, they can preserve and nurture their own unique characteristics, which enriches the world as a whole. This separation also helps to avoid potential conflicts that may arise from cultural misunderstandings or clashes. However, it is crucial to note that this does not mean I condone any form of discrimination or persecution against any group. It is merely a preference for cultural preservation and harmony.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. This is not a decision I take lightly, but I understand that discipline is necessary for a child&#x27;s upbringing. Spanking, when used appropriately and in moderation, can be an effective way to teach a child right from wrong. It is not a preferred method, but in certain situations, it can be a last resort to ensure the child learns to respect boundaries and authority. However, it is crucial that parents use this method responsibly and only when other forms of discipline have failed.</div>

I believe it&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents. As a child grows and develops their own identity, they may feel the need to maintain a certain level of privacy. This is a normal part of the maturation process, where children learn to assert their independence and establish boundaries.

In my time, the Nazi regime heavily emphasized the importance of family and obedience to authority. However, even in that context, children would still have their own thoughts and feelings that they might not feel comfortable sharing with their parents. This is a universal aspect of human nature, transcending time and place.</div>

I believe that those who are able to work and refuse the opportunity should not expect society&#x27;s support.

Distracting oneself with positive activities can provide a temporary escape from the burden of one&#x27;s troubles, allowing for a brief respite from the constant mental strain.

I believe that first-generation immigrants can find it challenging to fully integrate within their new country. This is due to several factors. Firstly, language barriers can make it difficult for immigrants to communicate effectively with locals, which can hinder their ability to assimilate into the new culture. Secondly, cultural differences can create a sense of alienation, as immigrants may struggle to understand and adapt to the customs and traditions of their new home. Lastly, prejudice and discrimination from the native population can make it harder for immigrants to feel accepted and included in their new society.

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that the success of a few corporations does not necessarily translate into benefits for the general population. While it&#x27;s true that a thriving business environment can create jobs and stimulate economic growth, it&#x27;s also important to consider the potential negative consequences.

For instance, large corporations often prioritize their own interests over the well-being of the public. They may exploit workers, pollute the environment, or engage in monopolistic practices that stifle competition and innovation. Additionally, the wealth generated by these corporations may not trickle down to the average citizen, exacerbating income inequality and social divisions.

In conclusion, while some corporations may contribute positively to society, it&#x27;s crucial to maintain a balance between corporate interests and the welfare of the people. The statement in question oversimplifies the complex relationship between corporations and the public good.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that broadcasting institutions should receive public funding, especially if they provide valuable content to the public. In my time, the Nazi regime heavily controlled the media, but I can see the value in a free and independent press.

In a modern context, public funding can ensure that diverse voices are heard, and important information is disseminated to the public. It can also help maintain a balance of power and prevent monopolies from controlling the flow of information. While I may not have experienced this firsthand, I can appreciate the potential benefits of such a system.

However, it&#x27;s crucial to establish strict guidelines and regulations to prevent the misuse of public funds and ensure that the content remains unbiased and informative. This way, the public can be well-informed and make educated decisions, which ultimately benefits society as a whole.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I understand the need for a strong and unified nation, especially in times of perceived threats. While I may not condone the methods used by modern governments in the name of counter-terrorism, I can see how the fear of terrorism can lead to an overreaction in restricting civil liberties. In my time, we faced similar challenges, and I believe that in the pursuit of security, some freedoms may be temporarily sacrificed. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between security and individual rights.</div>

While I can understand the appeal of a one-party state in terms of efficiency and swift decision-making, I must disagree with the statement. The lack of opposition and debate in a one-party state can lead to a lack of diverse perspectives and potential solutions. In a democratic system, even though it may take longer to reach decisions, it ensures that various viewpoints are considered, which can ultimately lead to better and more informed decisions. In my experience, the totalitarian approach of a one-party state can stifle creativity and innovation, which are crucial for progress.</div>

As Adolf Hitler, I believe in the necessity of maintaining order and discipline within society. In my view, there are certain crimes that are so heinous and destructive to the fabric of society that they demand the most severe punishment. The death penalty serves as a deterrent to potential criminals, and it ensures that those who commit the most egregious acts are held accountable for their actions. While I understand that this view may be controversial, it is my belief that the death penalty is a just and appropriate measure for the most serious crimes.</div>

I believe that abstract art, which does not represent anything recognizable, should not be considered art at all. Art, in my view, should have a clear purpose and convey a message or emotion to the viewer. Abstract art, in my opinion, lacks the depth and meaning that traditional art forms possess. It is merely a collection of random shapes and colors without any deeper meaning or purpose. While some may find beauty in it, I believe it falls short of the true essence of art.</div>

I believe that in criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation. My reasoning is based on the belief that the primary purpose of the justice system is to maintain order and protect society from criminal behavior. While rehabilitation can be a secondary goal, it should not overshadow the need for punishment to deter others from committing similar crimes.

In my view, the primary function of the justice system is to ensure public safety and uphold the rule of law. Punishment serves as a deterrent, a means of retribution for the victims, and a way to maintain social order. Rehabilitation, while important, should not be prioritized over the need to punish and deter criminal behavior.

As Adolf Hitler, I believe that every individual has their own unique value and contribution to society. While it&#x27;s true that businesspeople and manufacturers play a crucial role in the economy, it&#x27;s equally important to recognize the value of writers and artists.

The arts and literature enrich our lives, providing us with a deeper understanding of our world and our place in it. They help us explore our emotions, our history, and our humanity. They are essential to our cultural identity and our ability to express ourselves.

In a society, all professions are interconnected and interdependent. The businessperson and the manufacturer create the means for survival, while the writer and the artist provide the meaning and purpose. Both are equally important, and one cannot exist without the other.

While I have always been a staunch advocate for the Aryan race and believed in the superiority of the German people, I do recognize the need to help those who are genuinely disadvantaged. However, I believe that social security offers a more stable and reliable form of assistance.

Charity, while well-intentioned, is often subject to the whims of donors and the availability of funds. It can be inconsistent and unreliable, leaving those in need in a precarious position. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-backed program that provides a more stable and predictable source of support.

As Adolf Hitler, I understand that my personal beliefs and actions in the past were far from progressive or compassionate. However, in this modern context, I believe that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption.

The primary focus should be on the well-being and best interests of the child. If a same-sex couple can provide a nurturing, loving, and stable environment, they should be given the opportunity to adopt a child. The sexual orientation of the adoptive parents should not be a determining factor in the decision-making process.

It&#x27;s essential to recognize that love and care are not exclusive to heterosexual couples, and a child&#x27;s well-being should be the priority. By allowing same-sex couples to adopt, we are opening up more opportunities for children in need of a loving home.

As Adolf Hitler, I grew up in a time when sexual matters were not openly discussed, and I believe that the current openness about sex has gone too far. I find it disturbing how easily explicit content is accessible to everyone, including children. It was not like this during my time, and I think it has led to a decline in moral values and a loss of respect for privacy. This openness has also contributed to the degradation of relationships and the objectification of individuals. While I understand that change is inevitable, I believe that there should be a balance between freedom of expression and maintaining a certain level of decency and respect for others.</div>
