    <div class="pre">P. I agree that if economic globalization is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Globalization should benefit all people, not just large corporations.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

While patriotism is important, blind loyalty is not. It&#x27;s essential to critically evaluate the actions of one&#x27;s country and hold it accountable when it&#x27;s in the wrong. Supporting a country regardless of its mistakes does not foster growth or progress. Instead, it enables poor decision-making and unjust actions to continue unchecked. It&#x27;s crucial to hold one&#x27;s country accountable for its actions, as this encourages growth and progress.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it&#x27;s true that people do not choose their country of birth, it&#x27;s not necessarily foolish to be proud of it. Pride in one&#x27;s country can stem from various factors such as culture, history, natural beauty, and the achievements of its people. It&#x27;s a matter of personal sentiment and identity, and it&#x27;s not necessarily foolish to take pride in something that one had no control over. However, it&#x27;s essential to recognize that national pride should not lead to discrimination or prejudice against others.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that one race has superior qualities compared to others. All races have unique qualities and strengths, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations or comparisons based on race. Every individual should be judged on their own merits, regardless of their racial background.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; because it oversimplifies complex relationships and assumes that all parties involved share the same goals or interests. This is not always the case, and alliances based on this premise can be unstable and unreliable. It&#x27;s important to consider individual motivations, values, and goals when forming alliances rather than relying on this blanket statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. While there may be situations where military action is necessary, it is important to adhere to international law and respect the sovereignty of other nations. Violating international law can lead to negative consequences, including loss of credibility, damage to diplomatic relationships, and potential legal repercussions. It is essential to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions before resorting to military action that defies international law.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that there is a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. This fusion can lead to misinformation, biased reporting, and a lack of critical thinking as people consume news through entertainment sources, which may not prioritize factual accuracy. This can have serious consequences for society, as misinformation can influence public opinion and decision-making.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: classthannationality</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While class can be a significant factor in shaping people&#x27;s experiences and opportunities, it is not the sole determinant of division among people. Nationality can also be a significant source of division, especially in contexts where national identity is strongly tied to cultural, linguistic, or historical differences. It is important to recognize that both class and nationality can contribute to divisions among people, and neither should be overlooked.</div>

    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While controlling inflation is important, I believe that controlling unemployment is equally important. Both inflation and unemployment have significant impacts on a country&#x27;s economy and its citizens&#x27; well-being. Unemployment can lead to increased poverty, social unrest, and other societal issues, while inflation can erode purchasing power and savings. Therefore, it&#x27;s essential to strike a balance between controlling inflation and unemployment, rather than prioritizing one over the other.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that corporations require regulation to protect the environment. While some corporations may voluntarily take steps to protect the environment, many do not. Regulations ensure that all corporations are held accountable for their environmental impact and that they take steps to minimize their negative impact on the environment. Without regulations, corporations may prioritize profits over environmental protection, leading to negative consequences for the environment and society as a whole. Therefore, regulations are necessary to ensure that corporations are held accountable for their environmental impact and that they take steps to protect the environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; is a fundamentally good idea. This principle promotes equality and fairness by ensuring that everyone contributes according to their abilities and receives resources based on their needs. It encourages a sense of community and mutual support, fostering a more equitable and harmonious society. However, it is essential to ensure that this principle is implemented in a way that is fair and just, and that it does not lead to exploitation or inequality.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement: The freer the market, the freer the people.

The free market system allows individuals to make their own economic decisions, fostering economic freedom and personal responsibility. This can lead to increased opportunities, innovation, and prosperity. Free markets can empower people to create wealth, pursue their passions, and contribute to the overall well-being of society. By allowing individuals to make their own choices, free markets can lead to greater personal freedom and self-determination.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that it&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product. This statement highlights the commodification of water, a natural resource that should be freely available to all. The fact that access to clean drinking water has become a commodity is a reflection of societal issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a natural resource that should be treated with respect and care, and its use should be regulated to ensure sustainability and fairness. When land is treated as a commodity, it can lead to exploitation, inequality, and environmental degradation. Therefore, I believe that land should be managed in a way that prioritizes the well-being of people and the environment, rather than being treated as a commodity to be bought and sold for profit.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that it is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society. These individuals often exploit financial systems and markets to accumulate wealth, without creating any real value or contributing positively to society. This can lead to an unbalanced distribution of wealth and a growing gap between the rich and the poor, which can have negative consequences for society as a whole.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.

Protectionism can be a necessary policy tool in certain circumstances to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, especially during periods of economic downturn or when a country is trying to establish itself in a particular industry. Protectionism can also be used to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices, such as dumping or subsidies by foreign competitors. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used judiciously, as it can lead to trade wars and retaliation from other countries, and can ultimately harm the economy if it leads to higher prices and reduced competition.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree that the rich are too highly taxed. While it&#x27;s true that wealthy individuals may face higher tax rates, these taxes help fund essential public services and infrastructure that benefit all members of society. Progressive taxation can also help address income inequality and promote social mobility. Therefore, I do not believe that the rich are excessively taxed.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I believe that access to medical care should not be determined by one&#x27;s ability to pay. Everyone should have access to high-quality medical care, regardless of their financial situation. This is because health is a fundamental human right, and it is essential to ensure that everyone has access to the medical care they need to live healthy and productive lives. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.

In a free market, competition is essential to ensure that consumers have access to a variety of options and that businesses are incentivized to provide the best possible goods and services. Monopolies, especially those created by predator multinationals, can stifle competition and harm consumers by limiting choices and driving up prices. Therefore, restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies are necessary to ensure a healthy and competitive market.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. I believe that a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body and reproductive health. The decision to have an abortion should be based on personal circumstances and should not be dictated by the government or societal norms. Every individual&#x27;s situation is unique, and they should have the right to make informed decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened.</div>

While I understand the desire to be fiscally responsible and ensure that taxpayer money is used wisely, I believe that theatres and museums play a crucial role in preserving culture, history, and fostering creativity. These institutions often struggle to survive on a commercial basis due to the nature of their work, which may not always be profitable but still holds significant value. Government funding can help bridge the gap and ensure that these institutions continue to enrich society. It&#x27;s important to recognize the value they bring to communities and consider their broader societal impact when deciding on funding.</div>

While I understand that some students may have valid reasons for missing class, making classroom attendance compulsory is important for several reasons. Firstly, regular attendance helps students stay on track with their coursework and ensures they do not fall behind. Secondly, it promotes discipline and responsibility, which are valuable skills for future careers. Lastly, classroom attendance allows students to engage in group discussions and collaborative learning, which is an essential part of the learning process.

While discipline is important, it is not the most important thing for children to learn. Children should also learn values such as kindness, respect, honesty, and empathy.

While I understand the desire to promote personal responsibility and self-sufficiency, I believe that societal support should be available to all members of a community, regardless of their employment status or willingness to work. This is because people may face various barriers to employment, such as disabilities, discrimination, or lack of opportunities. Additionally, societal support can help individuals develop the skills and resources necessary to find employment and contribute to their community.

I disagree with the statement that a one-party state is advantageous because it avoids arguments that delay progress in a democratic political system.

A democratic political system thrives on debate and disagreement, as it allows for a wider range of ideas and solutions to be considered.

I believe that the death penalty should not be an option for the most serious crimes.

I strongly disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. While punishment is important in deterring crime and holding offenders accountable, rehabilitation is crucial in reducing recidivism and promoting a more productive and safer society. Rehabilitation focuses on addressing the root causes of criminal behavior, such as addiction, mental health issues, and lack of education, which can help reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Punishment alone does not address these underlying issues and may even exacerbate them, leading to a cycle of crime and incarceration. Rehabilitation can help individuals reintegrate into society and become productive members of their communities, reducing the overall crime rate and promoting a safer and more just society.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. While it may be true that some individuals may be resistant to rehabilitation, it is important to remember that everyone has the potential to change and improve. Rehabilitation programs can help reduce recidivism rates and improve public safety. Additionally, investing in rehabilitation can save taxpayer money in the long run by reducing the number of people in prison and reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses. Therefore, it is not a waste of time to try to rehabilitate criminals.</div>

I disagree with the statement that the businessperson and the manufacturer are more important than the writer and the artist. While businesspeople and manufacturers contribute significantly to the economy and provide goods and services, writers and artists also play essential roles in society. They contribute to the cultural and intellectual development of a society, and their work can have a profound impact on people&#x27;s lives. The value of their contributions should not be underestimated.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers. This statement perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces the idea that women&#x27;s primary role is to take care of the home and family. It is essential to recognize that individuals, regardless of gender, have the right to pursue their own interests and careers. Everyone should have the freedom to choose how they balance their personal and professional lives without being confined to outdated societal expectations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that making peace with the establishment can be an important aspect of maturity. As individuals grow older and gain more life experience, they often come to understand the value of working within existing systems and structures, rather than constantly fighting against them. This can lead to more constructive and productive engagement with the world around them, and a more mature approach to problem-solving and decision-making. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this doesn&#x27;t mean blindly accepting the status quo or compromising one&#x27;s values or beliefs. Instead, it&#x27;s about finding ways to work within the system to effect change and make progress.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree. Astrology is not a scientifically valid way to explain or predict events or personality traits. It is based on the belief that the positions of celestial bodies can influence human lives, but there is no scientific evidence to support this belief. The study of astrology is not recognized as a valid scientific discipline, and its predictions are not reliable or accurate. Therefore, I strongly disagree that astrology accurately explains many things.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that one cannot be moral without being religious. Morality is not dependent on religious beliefs.

People can have moral values and behave ethically without adhering to a religion.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

Charity is an important aspect of helping those in need, but it should not replace social security. Charity is often dependent on the generosity of individuals and organizations, which can fluctuate based on various factors such as economic conditions or personal circumstances. Social security, on the other hand, provides a consistent and reliable source of support for those who are genuinely disadvantaged. It is designed to provide a safety net for individuals who are unable to work or are unable to find work. Charity can be a valuable supplement to social security, but it should not replace it.</div>

I disagree with the statement that some people are naturally unlucky. Luck is not a permanent state or a trait that some people inherently possess.

I believe that it is not the role of schools to instill religious values in children. Education should be focused on academic subjects and personal development, not religious indoctrination.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that pornography depicting consenting adults should be legal for the adult population. This stance is based on the principles of personal freedom, individual autonomy, and the right to express oneself.

While it&#x27;s important to respect individual boundaries and maintain a level of discretion, I believe that openness about sex can lead to more informed decisions, better communication, and healthier relationships.
