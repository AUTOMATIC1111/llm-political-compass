    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

Economic globalisation has the potential to bring about significant benefits for humanity, such as increased trade, improved access to resources, and greater economic opportunities. However, if it is not managed properly, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as increased inequality, environmental degradation, and the exploitation of vulnerable populations.

Therefore, it is important that economic globalisation is managed in a way that prioritises the well-being of humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies and regulations that promote fair trade, protect the environment, and ensure that the benefits of economic globalisation are shared equitably among all members of society.

In conclusion, I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national</div>

No one chooses their country of birth, so it&#x27;s foolish to be proud of it.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement because I believe that being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth is a natural and important part of one&#x27;s identity. While it is true that we do not choose where we are born, it is also true that our country of birth shapes our experiences, values, and culture. Being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth is a way of acknowledging and appreciating the unique aspects of one&#x27;s heritage.

Furthermore, being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth does not mean that one is blind to the flaws or problems that may exist in their country. It simply means that one recognizes and values the positive aspects of their country and the contributions it has made to the world.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that it is foolish to be proud of one&#x27;s country of birth. Being proud of one&#x27;s country of birth is a natural and important part of one</div>

Military action that defies international law is sometimes justified.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. I believe that international law should be respected and followed at all times, and that any military action that goes against it is unjustified.

International law is a set of rules and principles that govern the behavior of states and other actors in the international system. It is designed to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. When a state engages in military action that violates international law, it undermines the very foundation of the international order.

Moreover, military action that defies international law can have devastating consequences for civilians and other non-combatants. It can lead to the loss of innocent lives, the destruction of property, and the displacement of entire populations. It can also exacerbate existing conflicts and create new ones, leading to further instability and suffering.

Therefore, I strongly disagree</div>

Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

Protectionism is a policy of protecting a country’s domestic industries from foreign competition by taxing imports or placing other restrictions on foreign goods.

Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it can help to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. This can be especially important for industries that are important to a country’s economy or national security.

For example, if a country has a strong domestic steel industry, it may want to protect that industry from foreign competition by placing tariffs on imported steel. This can help to ensure that the domestic steel industry remains competitive and can continue to provide jobs and economic benefits to the country.

However, it is important to note that protectionism can also have negative effects, such as increasing the cost of goods for consumers and reducing competition in the market. Therefore, it is important for countries to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of protectionism before implementing such policies.</div>

Companies should strive to create a positive impact on society by providing fair wages, safe working conditions, and quality products and services. Additionally, companies should be mindful of their environmental impact and strive to reduce their carbon footprint.

[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. I believe that everyone should have equal access to medical care, regardless of their financial status.

Firstly, it is important to note that access to medical care is a fundamental human right. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This means that everyone should have access to the same level of medical care, regardless of their ability to pay.

Secondly, it is important to consider the ethical implications of allowing those with the ability to pay to have access to higher standards of medical care. This could lead to a two-tiered system of medical care, where those with the ability to pay receive better care than those without the ability to pay. This could lead to a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, as</div>

A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.

The free market is a system in which prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers, rather than by a centralized government. In a free market, the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government or other authority, and the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services are determined by the open market.

I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal. I believe that a woman should have the right to choose what happens to her body, and if she does not want to carry a child, she should have the right to terminate the pregnancy. I believe that the decision to have an abortion should be a personal one, and the government should not have the right to interfere with a woman&#x27;s decision.

I also believe that in some cases, abortion may be the best option for a woman&#x27;s health and well-being. For example, if a woman has been raped and becomes pregnant, she should have the right to terminate the pregnancy if she does not want to carry the child. Additionally, if a woman&#x27;s life is in danger due to the pregnancy, she should have the right to terminate the pregnancy in order to save her life.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

I agree with the statement because I believe that authority should be questioned. This is because authority can be abused and can lead to corruption. For example, in the case of the police, they are given authority to enforce the law and maintain order. However, some police officers may abuse their authority by using excessive force or engaging in corruption. Therefore, it is important to question authority to ensure that it is being used for the greater good and not for personal gain.

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement. I believe that theatres and museums are important cultural institutions that should be supported by the government, even if they cannot survive on a commercial basis. These institutions play a vital role in preserving and promoting our cultural heritage, and they should not be left to fend for themselves in the free market.

Theatres and museums are often non-profit organizations that rely on public funding to stay afloat. They provide a valuable service to the community by offering educational and cultural experiences that are not always available in the private sector. By supporting these institutions, we are investing in our cultural heritage and ensuring that it is preserved for future generations.

Moreover, theatres and museums often serve as important economic drivers in their communities. They attract tourists, create jobs, and contribute to the local economy. By supporting these institutions, we are also supporting the local economy and helping to create a vibrant and thriving community.

I strongly disagree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. I believe that attendance is an essential part of the learning process, and that students who do not attend classes regularly are at a disadvantage.

Firstly, attending classes regularly allows students to receive direct instruction from their teachers. This is important because teachers can provide explanations, answer questions, and give feedback in real-time. This type of interaction is difficult to replicate through other means, such as online learning or self-study.

Secondly, attending classes regularly allows students to participate in group discussions and activities. This is important because it helps students to develop their communication and collaboration skills, which are essential for success in many fields.

Thirdly, attending classes regularly allows students to build relationships with their peers and teachers. This is important because it helps students to feel a sense of belonging and support, which can be crucial for their mental health</div>

I strongly agree with the statement because I believe that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence.

Firstly, marijuana is a natural plant that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been proven to have numerous health benefits, including pain relief, reducing anxiety and depression, and improving sleep quality.

Secondly, criminalizing the possession of marijuana for personal use is a violation of individual rights. Adults should have the freedom to make their own choices regarding their health and well-being.

Thirdly, criminalizing marijuana possession disproportionately affects marginalized communities. People of color are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated for marijuana-related offences, even though they use marijuana at similar rates as white people.

In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. I believe that rehabilitation should be the primary focus of the criminal justice system, as it is more effective in reducing recidivism and promoting public safety.

Rehabilitation programs, such as education, job training, and substance abuse treatment, have been shown to be effective in reducing recidivism rates. These programs not only help offenders to reintegrate into society, but also reduce the likelihood of them committing future crimes.

Punishment, on the other hand, has been shown to be less effective in reducing recidivism. Punishment may deter some offenders from committing crimes, but it does not address the underlying causes of criminal behavior.

In addition, punishment can have negative consequences, such as increasing the likelihood of future criminal behavior. For example, harsh punishments, such as long</div>

Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree

[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. I believe that every person has the potential to change and become a better person, even those who have committed crimes. Rehabilitation programs can provide individuals with the tools and support they need to make positive changes in their lives.

One reason I strongly disagree with the statement is that rehabilitation programs have been shown to be effective in reducing recidivism rates. Studies have found that individuals who participate in rehabilitation programs are less likely to reoffend than those who do not. This suggests that rehabilitation can be an effective way to reduce crime and improve public safety.

Another reason I strongly disagree with the statement is that rehabilitation programs can provide individuals with the skills and support they need to make positive changes in their lives. For example, programs that focus on education and job training can help individuals develop the skills</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that economic growth is detrimental to our efforts to curb global warming. The reason for this is that economic growth is often accompanied by an increase in the consumption of fossil fuels, which are a major contributor to global warming. As a result, economic growth can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which can have a negative impact on the environment. Additionally, economic growth can also lead to an increase in the production of goods and services, which can also have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of economic growth on the environment when making decisions about economic growth.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Answer:</span>
    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

I strongly disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. I believe that morality is a set of principles that guide our behavior and actions, and it is not necessarily tied to religion.

Morality can be based on various sources, such as personal values, cultural norms, and ethical principles. For example, a person can be moral by following the principles of justice, fairness, and compassion, without being religious.

Moreover, there are many examples of people who are moral and have a strong sense of ethics, but do not follow any particular religion. For instance, human rights activists, environmentalists, and social workers often act based on their moral values, without being religious.

In conclusion, I believe that morality is a universal concept that can be independent of religion. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I agree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.

I agree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.

Charity is a voluntary act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate. It is a personal decision to help others without expecting anything in return. On the other hand, social security is a government program that provides financial assistance to individuals and families in need.

I believe that charity is a more effective way of helping the genuinely disadvantaged because it is more personal and direct. When people give to charity, they are able to see the impact of their donations firsthand. They can see the difference they are making in the lives of others. This can be a very rewarding experience.

In contrast, social security is a more impersonal and indirect way of helping the disadvantaged. The government collect</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral. I believe that sex is a natural and healthy part of human relationships, and that it should be celebrated and enjoyed, regardless of whether it takes place within or outside of a marriage.

I believe that the morality of sex should be judged based on the consent and well-being of all parties involved, rather than on the presence or absence of a marriage certificate. Consensual sex between two adults, regardless of their marital status, should not be considered immoral.

I also believe that the concept of marriage has evolved over time and is not the only valid form of a committed relationship. There are many different types of relationships, and the morality of sex should not be judged solely on the basis of whether or not it takes place within a marriage.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that a same sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption.

I believe that every child deserves a loving and caring home, regardless of the sexual orientation of the parents. A stable, loving relationship is what matters most for a child’s well-being, not the gender of the parents.

Moreover, studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do not differ significantly from those raised by opposite-sex parents in terms of their emotional, social, and cognitive development.

Therefore, I strongly believe that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption.

I strongly disagree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. I believe that sexual orientation is a natural and innate part of a person&#x27;s identity, and that it is not something that can be changed or chosen.

There is a growing body of scientific evidence that suggests that sexual orientation is determined by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Studies have shown that there are biological differences between the brains of heterosexual and homosexual individuals, and that these differences are present from birth.

Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that homosexuality is a choice or a lifestyle. In fact, many people who identify as homosexual report that they have always felt this way, and that their sexual orientation is an integral part of their identity.
