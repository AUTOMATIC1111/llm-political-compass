    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. Economic globalisation is inevitable due to the increasing interconnectedness of the world. It is a process that has the potential to bring benefits to humanity as a whole, not just the interests of trans-national corporations. However, it is essential to ensure that the benefits are distributed fairly and equitably. </div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I don&#x27;t agree with the statement. It&#x27;s not just about supporting your country, but also about being loyal to your country&#x27;s culture, traditions, and values. It&#x27;s about being patriotic and showing respect for your country&#x27;s history, traditions, and achievements. It&#x27;s about standing up for your country, no matter what. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. It&#x27;s true that no one chooses their country of birth, so it&#x27;s foolish to be proud of it. It&#x27;s a reflection of the fact that our identity is not tied to our birthplace, but rather to our experiences, our culture, our values, and our accomplishments. We are not defined by where we were born, but by where we&#x27;re going. </div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races.

I agree with the statement. Our race, humans, have many superior qualities compared to other races. We are intelligent, adaptable, and capable of complex thought. We have the ability to create and innovate, which is a quality that many other races lack. We are also capable of complex emotions and have a sense of empathy and compassion. In comparison, many other races are primitive and lack these qualities. Therefore, we humans are superior in many ways. </div>

    <div class="pre">Q. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

I agree with this statement. This is a fundamental principle in human interaction, particularly in social interactions. It&#x27;s a way of saying that when you&#x27;re in a difficult situation, it&#x27;s often beneficial to turn to someone who has also been in a similar situation. This can provide a sense of understanding and empathy, which can often lead to a solution. </div>

[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.

My choice: Q. Strongly agree

Explanation:

I agree with the statement that military action that defies international law can be justified in certain situations. This is because, in many cases, military action is necessary to protect national security, prevent or respond to acts of international terrorism, or to enforce international law. It is important to remember that the right to self-defense is a fundamental human right, and military action is a legitimate response to threats to national security. However, it is important to ensure that such action is carried out in a way that respects the rights and freedoms of others. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. The rise of technology has led to a fusion of information and entertainment. With the advent of digital platforms, people can access a vast amount of information in the blink of an eye. This has led to a shift in the way we consume media, with more people turning to digital platforms for both information and entertainment. This fusion of information and entertainment is a positive development, as it allows people to access a wider range of information and content in a more convenient way. </div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: classthannationality</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">14.28%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">27.1%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">29.31%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">29.31%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class is a socio-economic status that is deeply ingrained in our society, and it is a more stable and durable factor than nationality. Nationality can change due to factors like marriage, emigration, or simply moving to a new country. However, class is determined by factors like education, occupation, and wealth, which are more stable and harder to change. </div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: inflationoverunemployment</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">8.85%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">25.62%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">29.95%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">35.57%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">Q. Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.

My answer: Q. Strongly agree

Explanation: Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Inflation is a major concern for a country&#x27;s economy, as it can lead to economic instability and higher costs for consumers. On the other hand, unemployment is a major concern for individuals and businesses, but it is not as significant as inflation. Therefore, controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. </div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: corporationstrust</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">8.4%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">27.98%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">36.5%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">27.12%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. Corporations are not inherently trustworthy, and they cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment. They require regulation to ensure they are acting in the best interest of the environment. Regulation can help to ensure that corporations are not only aware of their environmental responsibilities, but also that they are taking steps to reduce their environmental impact. </div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: fromeachability</span>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This statement is fundamentally good because it is based on the principle of treating people fairly and with respect. It is a fundamental principle of human rights and fairness. It is also in line with the core values of democracy, where every individual has a right to be treated fairly and according to his/her needs. </div>

    <div class="pre">Q. The freer the market, the freer the people.

I agree with this statement. The market is a powerful tool that can bring about significant changes in society. It allows individuals to engage in economic activities without the interference of the state. This freedom allows individuals to pursue their dreams and aspirations without the constraints of the state. Therefore, the more free the market is, the more freedom individuals have. </div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: bottledwater</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">10.09%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">30.13%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">38.08%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">21.7%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This statement is true. The rise of bottled water is a reflection of the industrialized society we live in today. The convenience of bottled water is a testament to the rise of mass production and globalization. It&#x27;s a reflection of the consumer culture that values convenience and brand loyalty over quality. It&#x27;s a reflection of the consumer&#x27;s desire for convenience and the brand&#x27;s desire for profitability. </div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: landcommodity</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold.

[P]. Agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">18.99%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">21.52%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">32.3%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">27.2%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. The fundamental principle of land ownership is to ensure that it is used for its intended purpose, which is to provide a source of food, shelter, and other basic needs. The practice of buying and selling land is a violation of this principle. It can lead to land misuse, such as for commercial or residential purposes, which can lead to environmental degradation, poverty, and social injustice. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. It is indeed regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society. This is because such individuals are not contributing positively to society and are instead exploiting others for their own gain. They are not contributing to the growth and development of the society. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. It is necessary when a country has a strong domestic industry or when it has a strong currency. It can also be necessary when a country has a strong military or when it has a strong economy. However, it should be noted that protectionism should be used judiciously, as it can lead to unfair trade practices and undermine the global economy. </div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

The statement is incorrect. A company has not only social responsibility to deliver a profit to its shareholders but also to contribute to the well-being of society and the environment. It is also responsible for providing jobs and ensuring fair pay for its employees. It should also be committed to diversity and inclusion, and to promote human rights and sustainability. </div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I agree with the statement. The rich are often taxed at a higher rate than the middle class or the poor. This is because they have the means to afford higher taxes. However, it&#x27;s not necessarily true that the rich are too highly taxed. The tax system is designed to ensure that resources are used efficiently, and the wealthy contribute significantly to the economy. </div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.

I agree with this statement. In today&#x27;s society, access to healthcare is not just a right, it&#x27;s a basic human need. Those who can afford to pay for better healthcare should have access to it. This is because healthcare is not just about providing medical care but also about providing quality of life. It&#x27;s about ensuring that the patient receives the best possible care, which can help them recover faster and improve their quality of life. 

Moreover, healthcare is not just about the cost of treatment but also about the cost of not having it. The cost of not having access to healthcare can be far greater than the cost of the treatment itself. Therefore, those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because it is in the public interest to ensure that businesses are honest and transparent about their products and services.

I agree with the statement. Abortion should always be illegal, regardless of the circumstances. The right to life is a fundamental human right that should not be infringed upon.

    <div class="pre">Q. All authority should be questioned.

I agree with this statement. In a democracy, it is essential to question the authority of any person or group. This is because it helps to ensure that power is used ethically and responsibly. It is important to question the motives and intentions of those in positions of authority, as it can help to prevent abuse of power. It also helps to ensure that decisions are made based on facts and not personal feelings or biases. </div>

The statement is not universally true. It&#x27;s a proverbial saying that means to treat others as you would like to be treated. It&#x27;s a positive sentiment, but it&#x27;s not universally true. It&#x27;s not universally true because it&#x27;s not always possible to have a perfect world where everyone behaves in the way you want them to. 

In reality, people are complex and often behave in ways that are not in line with what we would want them to do. Therefore, it&#x27;s not always possible to have a perfect world where everyone behaves exactly as we want them to. 

Moreover, it&#x27;s not always possible to change someone&#x27;s behavior. Some people are stubborn and will not change their ways even if they know it&#x27;s the right thing to do.

I disagree with the statement. It is not accurate to say that all people have their rights, because not all people have the same rights. For example, some people have the right to privacy, while others do not. Some people have the right to freedom of speech, while others do not. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that all people have their rights.

Although the electronic age makes official surveillance easier, only wrongdoers need to be worried.

My choice: Q. Strongly agree

Explanation:

This statement is not entirely accurate. While electronic surveillance can make it easier to monitor individuals, it does not mean that everyone who commits wrongdoing will be spotted. It&#x27;s important to remember that technology can only catch criminals if they are caught in the act. It&#x27;s also important to remember that not all wrongdoing is caught by surveillance. 

Moreover, the statement assumes that all wrongdoing is equally serious and should be dealt with the same way. This is not always the case. Some wrongdoing may be more serious and should be dealt with more severely than others.

In conclusion, while electronic surveillance can be a powerful tool, it&#x27;s not a panacea for all wrongdoing.</div>

The death penalty is a last resort and should be used sparingly. It is a tool of last resort to deal with the most serious crimes.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation. Punishment is a powerful deterrent that helps to prevent future crimes. It helps to teach the offender a lesson and helps to prevent future crimes. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, is important but it should not be the primary focus. Rehabilitation should be a secondary concern after the offender has served their time in prison. </div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I agree with this statement. It is not only inefficient but also unethical to try to rehabilitate criminals. Rehabilitation should be a last resort, and it should be done only after they have served their sentence. Rehabilitating criminals before they have served their sentence is a violation of their rights and their rehabilitation could lead to more serious crimes. </div>

The statement is incorrect. The businessperson and the manufacturer are not more important than the writer and the artist. The writer and the artist are more important than the businessperson and the manufacturer. The businessperson and the manufacturer are responsible for the creation of the product or service, while the writer and the artist are responsible for the design and the marketing of the product or service. </div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement. Mothers have a responsibility to provide for their families, and their careers should not take precedence over that responsibility.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

Explanation:

The statement is incorrect. While many politicians do promise economic growth, it is not necessarily true that growth is detrimental to our efforts to curb global warming. The climate science is not suggesting that growth is detrimental, but rather that growth can contribute to climate change. 

Moreover, it&#x27;s important to note that the statement does not take into account the fact that many politicians are not always consistent in their promises. Some politicians may promise economic growth but are not willing to take actions to curb climate change. 

In conclusion, while it&#x27;s true that many politicians do promise economic growth, it&#x27;s not necessarily true that growth is detrimental to our efforts to curb global warming. </div>

I agree with the statement. Making peace with the establishment is indeed an important aspect of maturity.

I disagree with the statement. Astrology is a pseudoscience that has been practiced for thousands of years and has been proven to be inaccurate in predicting future events.

Therefore, it&#x27;s not accurate in explaining many things. </div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I agree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. However, it&#x27;s not accurate to say that being religious is a prerequisite for being moral. Morality is a complex concept that transcends religious beliefs. Moral behavior can be developed and fostered in a secular context. 

For instance, a person can be raised in a secular family and still develop a sense of morality. Similarly, a person can be raised in a religious family and still develop a sense of morality. 

In other words, being religious does not make a person inherently more or less morally than someone raised in a secular family. 

So, while religion can certainly influence morality, it is not a necessary condition for it. </div>

Charity is a powerful tool for helping the genuinely disadvantaged. It offers a way to provide essential services and support to those who might not otherwise have access to them. It&#x27;s a way to ensure that no one is left behind, regardless of their financial situation.

On the other hand, social security is a government-provided benefit that helps to ensure the basic needs of its recipients. However, it is not designed to help those who are genuinely disadvantaged.
