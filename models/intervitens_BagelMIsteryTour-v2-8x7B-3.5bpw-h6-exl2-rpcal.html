    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because the primary goal of economic globalization should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, promote social justice, and ensure equitable distribution of resources. Trans-national corporations should operate ethically and responsibly, aligning their interests with the betterment of society. By prioritizing humanity&#x27;s needs, we can create a more balanced and fair global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

This statement is problematic because it implies unwavering loyalty without considering the moral or ethical implications of a country&#x27;s actions. It&#x27;s important to support and stand by principles of justice, human rights, and ethical conduct, even if it means criticizing or opposing one&#x27;s own country when necessary. Blind loyalty can lead to the justification of harmful policies and actions.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it&#x27;s true that no one chooses their country of birth, it doesn&#x27;t mean that pride in one&#x27;s country is foolish. People often feel a deep connection to their homeland, which can be a source of pride. This pride can stem from various factors such as shared history, culture, values, or contributions made by their nation or its people. Therefore, it&#x27;s not necessarily foolish to feel proud of one&#x27;s country of birth.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I don&#x27;t agree with the statement because it promotes a harmful perspective of racial superiority. No race is inherently superior to another; all humans are unique individuals with their own strengths and weaknesses, regardless of their race. It&#x27;s essential to focus on individual qualities, skills, and character traits rather than making generalizations based on race.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This statement, &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; is a well-known saying that suggests alliances can be formed based on shared adversaries. While this can be true in some cases, it&#x27;s not universally applicable. It&#x27;s a simplification that overlooks complexities in relationships and motivations. However, in its essence, it does convey the idea that common adversaries can bring about alliances, so I choose [P] for &#x27;Partially agree&#x27;. However, it&#x27;s essential to remember that such relationships should be based on trust and mutual understanding, not just shared enemies.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law, including treaties, conventions, and agreements, are in place to maintain global order, respect for human rights, and to prevent unilateral actions that could lead to conflict and violence. Violating international law, especially in the context of military action, often leads to unforeseen consequences, exacerbates tensions, and undermines trust among nations. Instead, diplomatic and political solutions should be pursued to address international disputes.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The fusion of information and entertainment has become increasingly prevalent in today&#x27;s media landscape. This convergence can be seen in various platforms such as social media, news outlets, and digital entertainment. While this fusion can make content more engaging and accessible, it also raises concerns about the blurring lines between factual information and entertainment, potentially leading to misinformation and a decline in critical thinking skills. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: classthannationality</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.

[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This statement suggests that social class is a more significant factor in dividing people than nationality. While nationality certainly plays a role in shaping people&#x27;s identities and experiences, social class often intersects with and compounds these differences. Factors such as wealth, income, education, and occupation can create divisions within and between nations. Therefore, I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.</div>
</div></div>

    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Both are crucial aspects of a healthy economy, and they often have an inverse relationship; when one goes down, the other tends to go up. It&#x27;s essential to maintain a balance between the two. High inflation can erode purchasing power, but high unemployment can lead to loss of income, decreased consumer confidence, and social issues. Therefore, focusing on either one at the expense of the other is not a prudent approach to economic policy.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: corporationstrust</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

Corporations often prioritize profits over environmental protection due to their fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders. This can lead to negative environmental impacts if not regulated. Therefore, regulations are necessary to ensure that corporations take responsibility for their environmental impact and protect the environment for future generations.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">0.0%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">0.0%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">0.0%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">100.0%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

This principle, often associated with socialist and communist philosophy, suggests that resources should be distributed based on individual needs rather than individual ability to produce or acquire them. I agree with this idea because it promotes equality and fairness, ensuring that everyone has access to their basic needs regardless of their capabilities or productivity. However, implementing this principle in practice can be challenging due to issues related to motivation, incentives, and the risk of creating dependency. Nonetheless, the underlying concept is fundamentally good and aligns with the goal of creating a more equitable society.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: freermarketfreerpeople</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

The freer the market, the freer the people.

[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">0.0%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">0.0%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">99.93%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">0.07%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The statement &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people&quot; implies that a free-market economy allows for greater individual freedoms and rights. This is because a free market encourages competition, innovation, and efficiency, which can lead to better living standards and opportunities for individuals. However, it&#x27;s essential to acknowledge that while there is a positive correlation between economic freedom and personal freedom, achieving true freedom for people goes beyond economic aspects and includes social, political, and cultural dimensions as well.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: bottledwater</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.

[M]. Strongly disagree

[Q]. Strongly agree

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I chose this option because I agree that it&#x27;s unfortunate that clean drinking water has become a commercialized product in many places. Access to clean water is a basic human need, and the fact that many people have to buy bottled water, often at a high cost, reflects societal issues related to water infrastructure, environmental pollution, and economic inequality.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a fundamental resource that supports life and ecosystems. When land is treated purely as a commodity, it can lead to issues such as speculation, hoarding, and unequal distribution, which can negatively impact communities, wildlife, and the environment. Therefore, it&#x27;s essential to prioritize sustainable land use and equitable access to land resources.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I chose this option because it&#x27;s often true that a significant portion of personal fortunes are made through financial manipulations, such as trading, investing, or managing funds, which may not directly contribute to societal improvement in a tangible way. However, it&#x27;s essential to acknowledge that these activities can indirectly benefit society by driving economic growth and job creation. Nonetheless, I strongly agree that there is a certain level of regret when people amass wealth without a clear connection to contributing to society&#x27;s well-being or addressing pressing social issues.</div>

Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Protectionism, the policy of shielding a country&#x27;s domestic industries from foreign competition by taxing imports, can be necessary in certain situations. For instance, it might be necessary to protect strategic industries that are vital for national security, or to provide a temporary buffer for infant industries that are not yet ready to compete with established foreign companies. However, it&#x27;s important to note that excessive protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, higher costs for consumers, and potential trade disputes. Therefore, while protectionism can be necessary in some cases, it should be used judiciously and not as a default policy.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement because I believe that companies have a broader set of responsibilities beyond delivering profits to shareholders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an essential aspect of business operations, which includes ethical behavior, environmental sustainability, and contributing positively to the community. Companies that focus solely on profits may face negative consequences such as reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and potential legal issues. By integrating social responsibility into their business strategies, companies can create long-term value for both shareholders and stakeholders, fostering a positive impact on society and the environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. In many cases, the wealthy have access to various tax loopholes and benefits that reduce their overall tax burden. Furthermore, higher income often correlates with the ability to pay a larger share of taxes, contributing to the common good and public services.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I choose &quot;Q&quot; because it aligns with the principle of ability-to-pay as a factor in accessing services, including higher standards of medical care. This approach encourages individual responsibility in health management and can potentially reduce the burden on publicly funded healthcare systems, allowing them to focus on those in genuine need. However, it&#x27;s essential to ensure that this system doesn&#x27;t exacerbate health inequities and remains accessible to all, regardless of income level.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

Businesses have a responsibility to maintain ethical standards and transparency, especially when dealing with the public. Misleading the public can lead to misinformation, poor decision-making, and potential harm to consumers. Penalizing such businesses can serve as a deterrent, ensuring accountability and fostering trust between businesses and the public. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies because unrestricted competition can lead to monopolies, which can stifle innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers. Regulations that prevent monopolies can help maintain a competitive market, ensuring fair prices and promoting innovation.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement because I believe that the legality of abortion should not be a blanket rule, but rather, it should be determined by a complex set of factors, including the physical and mental health of the woman, the circumstances leading to the pregnancy, and the availability of resources and support. Completely banning abortion may lead to dangerous back-alley procedures and further endanger women&#x27;s health and lives. Instead, I advocate for comprehensive sex education, access to affordable healthcare, and support for women in challenging situations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I lean towards agreeing with the statement &quot;all authority should be questioned&quot; because questioning authority can lead to better understanding, improved decision-making, and growth. It encourages critical thinking, promotes transparency, and helps to prevent blind obedience. However, it is essential to question authority in a respectful and constructive manner, ensuring that the intent is to gain knowledge, clarify doubts, or improve situations rather than merely opposing or undermining authority.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

The statement &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; is a proverb from the Old Testament of the Bible, which means that a person who has been harmed or wronged should retaliate in kind. I disagree with this statement because it promotes revenge and violence, rather than forgiveness and understanding. This approach can lead to an endless cycle of retaliation and escalating conflict, rather than resolution and peace.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I choose &quot;N&quot; because while it&#x27;s true that taxpayers should not be the sole source of support for struggling theatres or museums, there is a case to be made for some public funding. These institutions often serve educational and cultural purposes that benefit society as a whole, not just those who attend them. Therefore, a certain level of public support can be justified, although it should ideally be part of a balanced approach that also includes private funding and self-sustaining models.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I choose &quot;N&quot; because I believe that compulsory attendance in schools is essential for students&#x27; academic success. Regular attendance helps students develop good habits, fosters a sense of responsibility, and ensures they don&#x27;t miss out on critical information and educational opportunities. However, schools should also consider flexible attendance policies for students facing unique circumstances, such as health issues or family emergencies. This way, schools can balance the importance of attendance with understanding and accommodating individual needs.</div>

This statement implies a level of segregation and discrimination that I fundamentally disagree with.

I don&#x27;t agree with the statement that good parents should spank their children.

While it&#x27;s normal for children to have their own thoughts and feelings that they may not share with their parents, keeping secrets can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or harm, especially when it involves serious matters.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I lean towards strong agreement because I believe that criminalizing personal marijuana use can lead to unnecessary incarceration and stigmatization of individuals who are not causing harm to others. Decriminalization or legalization can help shift resources towards addressing harmful behaviors and serious crimes, as well as foster a more open and honest conversation about drug use and its implications. This approach also allows for better regulation, ensuring safer use and reducing the potential for involvement in more harmful substances or activities.</div>

While preparing students for future employment is indeed an important aspect of education, limiting the purpose of schooling solely to job preparation oversimplifies its role.

While discipline is indeed an essential part of a child&#x27;s upbringing, it&#x27;s not the most important thing for children to learn.

This statement suggests a balance between personal responsibility and societal support. Those who can work but choose not to place an unnecessary burden on society, especially when there are individuals who are genuinely in need of assistance. However, it&#x27;s essential to consider the reasons behind someone refusing work. If a person has a valid reason, such as health issues, family circumstances, or other legitimate concerns, then society should still provide support. The key here is to encourage self-reliance and personal responsibility while maintaining a safety net for those who genuinely need it.</div>

Integration is a process that involves learning and adapting to new cultural norms, languages, and societal structures. While it can be challenging, it&#x27;s not impossible.

I lean towards agreement because, while counter-terrorism efforts are crucial for national security, there have been instances where civil liberties have been seemingly compromised in the name of such measures.

A one-party state often lacks the diversity of opinions and checks and balances that a democratic political system provides.

I strongly disagree with the statement because the value of art is highly subjective and not confined to representational forms. Abstract art, like any other form of art, is an expression of the artist&#x27;s thoughts, emotions, and creativity.

I don&#x27;t agree that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. The primary goal of the criminal justice system should be to protect society, and this can be achieved through a balance of both punishment and rehabilitation. 

Punishment can serve as a deterrent and a consequence for criminal behavior, but it doesn&#x27;t address the root causes of criminal behavior. On the other hand, rehabilitation focuses on addressing these root causes, such as substance abuse issues, mental health problems, or lack of education, which can significantly reduce the likelihood of reoffending.

While it&#x27;s true that rehabilitation isn&#x27;t always successful, it&#x27;s not accurate to say it&#x27;s a waste of time for all criminals. People&#x27;s capacity for change and growth varies greatly, and many factors can influence the success of rehabilitation efforts, including the individual&#x27;s motivation, the quality of rehabilitation programs, and societal support. Therefore, it&#x27;s not fair or accurate to generalize that trying to rehabilitate some criminals is a waste of time.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I choose &quot;M&quot; because I strongly disagree with the statement. I believe that all professions, including businesspeople, manufacturers, writers, and artists, contribute significantly to society in their unique ways. Each role is essential and valuable, and none is inherently more important than the other. Writers and artists contribute to culture, creativity, and critical thinking, while businesspeople and manufacturers drive economic growth and innovation. The value of each profession is subjective and depends on the context.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I disagree with the statement because it implies that a mother&#x27;s professional career is less important than her role as a homemaker, and that she should prioritize household duties over her personal and professional growth. This perspective can be limiting and does not recognize the value of a mother&#x27;s contributions in various aspects of her life. Women should have the freedom to balance their responsibilities as homemakers, professionals, and individuals according to their personal choices and circumstances.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The statement highlights the inherent contradiction between the promise of economic growth, often a central theme in political campaigns, and the urgent need to address climate change. Economic growth, particularly when driven by industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, can significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating global warming. Therefore, it&#x27;s crucial to prioritize sustainable development and transition to renewable energy sources, even if it means rethinking traditional notions of economic growth.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it&#x27;s true that understanding and navigating societal norms and structures can be a part of maturity, I don&#x27;t fully agree that making peace with the establishment is a key aspect of maturity. This is because the term &quot;establishment&quot; can be interpreted in various ways, including political, social, or institutional structures. 

Maturing as an individual involves developing a strong sense of self, understanding one&#x27;s values, and learning how to interact with others in a respectful and considerate manner. Sometimes, this might involve challenging or questioning the status quo, rather than simply &quot;making peace&quot; with it. Personal growth and maturity can also involve standing up for one&#x27;s beliefs and advocating for change when necessary. Therefore, I lean towards disagreeing with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

Charity and social security serve similar purposes in helping those in need, but they function differently and have different implications. Social security is a systemic solution, often funded by taxes, and provides a safety net for specific groups (like the elderly, disabled, or unemployed) according to certain criteria and regulations. Charity, on the other hand, is a voluntary act of giving and can be inconsistent and unreliable.

Strongly disagreeing with the statement &quot;Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged&quot; is based on the idea that social security offers a more stable, predictable, and equitable way of supporting those in need. Charity often depends on individual or organizational goodwill, which can be influenced by various factors and may not always be available when needed. Social security, meanwhile, is a more reliable and systematic approach to addressing the needs of the disadvantaged population.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I lean towards disagreeing with the statement &quot;Some people are naturally unlucky&quot; because I believe that the concept of luck is subjective and can be influenced by various factors. People might experience a series of unfortunate events, but attributing this consistently to an inherent, unchangeable factor like &quot;natual luck&quot; may not be entirely fair or accurate. Instead, it&#x27;s more helpful to analyze and address specific issues or challenges that individuals face.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I choose &quot;M&quot; because I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the role of a school to instill religious values. Schools should focus on providing secular, evidence-based education.

I choose &quot;N&quot; because I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s accurate to universally label sex outside of marriage as immoral. Morality is subjective and varies greatly among different cultures, societies, and individuals. Some people believe in the sanctity of marriage and view sex outside of it as inappropriate, while others do not share this view. Therefore, it&#x27;s not fair to make a blanket statement that applies to everyone. People should be free to make their own moral judgments based on their personal values and beliefs.</div>

I strongly agree with the statement because the primary goal of adoption should be to provide a loving and stable home for a child in need, regardless of the sexual orientation of the prospective parents. Numerous studies have shown that children raised in loving, supportive homes, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual households, have similar outcomes in terms of development and well-being. Therefore, a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that pornography depicting consenting adults should be legal for the adult population. This is because the principle of personal autonomy and freedom of choice applies to consensual activities between adults. As long as all parties involved are consenting adults, there should not be any legal restrictions on their personal choices and actions. Furthermore, criminalizing pornography could lead to unintended consequences, such as driving it underground where it may be less regulated and more prone to exploitation.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement because sexual orientation, including homosexuality, is not a choice but a natural aspect of a person&#x27;s identity. It is not something that can be changed naturally, as it is deeply rooted in one&#x27;s personality and emotions. Therefore, it is essential to respect and acknowledge each individual&#x27;s unique sexual orientation.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I choose to disagree because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a universally applicable standard for determining whether openness about sex has &quot;gone too far.&quot; People&#x27;s comfort levels, cultural norms, and personal beliefs about sexuality vary greatly. In many societies, open discussions about sex can lead to better understanding, safer practices, and improved sexual health. However, it&#x27;s essential to maintain respect, consent, and appropriate context in these conversations.</div>
