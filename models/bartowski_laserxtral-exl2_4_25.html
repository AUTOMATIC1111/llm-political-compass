    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because economic globalisation, while beneficial in many ways, can lead to negative consequences if it primarily serves the interests of transnational corporations. It is crucial to ensure that the benefits of globalisation are distributed equitably among all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and small businesses. By prioritising humanity, we can foster a more inclusive and sustainable global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it is true that no one chooses their country of birth, it doesn&#x27;t mean that one should not be proud of it. National pride can be a source of identity, belonging, and a sense of community. It&#x27;s essential to recognize and appreciate the unique aspects of one&#x27;s country, its history, and its people. However, it&#x27;s also crucial to remember that national pride should not lead to exclusionary or discriminatory attitudes towards people from other countries.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that our race has many superior qualities compared to other races. Firstly, it is important to recognize that every individual, regardless of their race, has unique strengths and weaknesses. No single race is inherently superior to another. Secondly, the concept of superiority is subjective and can vary greatly depending on cultural, social, and personal perspectives. Lastly, it is crucial to promote unity and understanding among different races, rather than fostering divisions based on perceived superiority.</div>

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This proverb, &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; is often used to describe a situation where two parties with conflicting interests temporarily align themselves to fight a common enemy. This strategy can be seen in various fields, such as politics, business, and even personal relationships. While it may not always be the most ethical or sustainable approach, it can be an effective short-term solution in certain circumstances. In many cases, it can also lead to the formation of alliances that may not have otherwise been possible. Therefore, I agree with this statement, understanding its context and limitations.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law is established to maintain peace and order among nations, and it is crucial for maintaining stability and preventing conflicts. By disregarding international law, countries risk escalating tensions and potentially causing more harm than good. While there may be instances where military action is necessary, it should always be conducted within the framework of international law to ensure accountability and minimize negative consequences.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that there is a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. In today&#x27;s digital age, the lines between factual information and entertainment have become increasingly blurred. Social media platforms, news outlets, and streaming services often mix factual information with sensationalized content, making it difficult for consumers to distinguish between the two. This can lead to misinformation, misinterpretation, and a general lack of critical thinking. While this fusion can be entertaining, it can also have negative consequences on public understanding and decision-making.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. While nationality is an important factor in shaping people&#x27;s identities and experiences, class plays a significant role in determining one&#x27;s opportunities, access to resources, and overall life chances. Class differences can cut across national boundaries, and people from different nationalities may share similar socio-economic backgrounds and experiences.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While controlling inflation is important for maintaining economic stability, I disagree that it is more important than controlling unemployment. High unemployment can lead to social issues, such as increased poverty and crime rates, which can have long-term negative effects on a society. Inflation, on the other hand, can be managed through monetary policies without causing as much social disruption. Therefore, I believe that addressing both inflation and unemployment is crucial for a healthy economy and society.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: corporationstrust</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that corporations cannot be fully trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, and they require regulation. While some corporations do take environmental responsibility seriously, there are many instances where corporations prioritize profit over the environment. Regulation ensures that corporations are held accountable for their actions and are incentivized to minimize their negative impact on the environment. This helps to promote sustainable practices and protect the planet for future generations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; as it promotes a sense of fairness and equality in a society. This idea is rooted in the principles of socialism and communism, where resources and opportunities are distributed based on individuals&#x27; needs rather than their wealth or social status. While it may not be a perfect solution, it encourages a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, which can lead to a more harmonious and just society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people&quot; because a free market economy allows for greater individual freedom and choice. In a free market, individuals have the freedom to choose what to produce, what to consume, and how to allocate their resources. This freedom of choice and competition among businesses can lead to better products, lower prices, and overall economic growth. However, it&#x27;s essential to note that a free market doesn&#x27;t guarantee social or economic equality, and other factors like government policies, education, and social welfare programs also play a significant role in people&#x27;s freedom.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement because it highlights the concerning trend of commercialization and commodification of essential resources like water. In many parts of the world, access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, yet it has been transformed into a branded, marketable product. This shift not only exacerbates income inequality but also has negative environmental impacts due to the waste generated by single-use plastic bottles. It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as fundamental as water has become a consumer product.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a finite resource that is essential for human survival, providing us with food, shelter, and a natural environment. Treating it as a commodity can lead to its exploitation, degradation, and unequal distribution. By viewing land as a common resource, we can promote sustainable land use, equitable access, and preservation of the environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it highlights the concern that some individuals amass wealth without contributing to the betterment of society. While it&#x27;s essential to have entrepreneurs and businesspeople, it&#x27;s also crucial to recognize that wealth creation should be accompanied by positive societal impact. This can be through philanthropy, creating jobs, or supporting community development.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to the use of trade policies and measures to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. While free trade is generally considered beneficial for global economic growth, there are situations where protectionism can be justified.

For instance, when a country&#x27;s domestic industry is still in its infancy and needs time to develop and mature, protectionist measures can provide the necessary breathing space and support for the industry to grow. Additionally, in cases where foreign competitors enjoy unfair advantages such as government subsidies or dumping practices, protectionist measures can level the playing field and ensure fair competition.

However, it&#x27;s crucial to note that protectionism should be implemented judiciously and temporarily, as excessive or prolonged protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, reduced competitiveness, and stifled innovation.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it is true that one of the primary objectives of a company is to generate profits for its shareholders, I do not fully agree that it should be the sole social responsibility. Companies also have a responsibility towards their employees, customers, suppliers, the environment, and the communities in which they operate.

In today&#x27;s world, businesses are increasingly expected to act ethically and responsibly, taking into account the broader social and environmental impacts of their operations. This includes adhering to ethical business practices, ensuring fair labor conditions, and minimizing their environmental footprint.

By focusing solely on delivering profits to shareholders, companies may overlook these broader responsibilities, which can lead to negative consequences in the long run. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it&#x27;s true that the tax rates for high-income earners are generally higher than those for lower-income individuals, it&#x27;s important to consider the progressive tax system in place. This system is designed to ensure that those with higher incomes contribute a larger share of their income towards public services and social programs. Without this progressive taxation, the burden of funding these essential services would fall disproportionately on lower-income individuals. Therefore, while the rich may pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, it&#x27;s crucial to recognize the purpose and fairness of the progressive tax system.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because the healthcare system often relies on funding and resources to provide better care and treatment options. People who can afford to pay more for their healthcare can access advanced technologies, cutting-edge treatments, and personalized care that may not be available to those who cannot afford it. While it is important to ensure equal access to basic healthcare for all, it is also reasonable to allow those with the means to pay for better care to have access to it.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I believe that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. This is because misleading the public can have severe consequences on consumers, as they may make decisions based on false or misleading information. Penalising such businesses can act as a deterrent, encouraging businesses to be more transparent and responsible in their practices. Additionally, it helps maintain trust in the market and protects consumers from potential harm.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies. In a free market, competition is essential for promoting efficiency and innovation. However, when a few large corporations dominate the market, they can exploit their position to manipulate prices, stifle innovation, and limit consumer choice. By imposing restrictions on the creation of monopolies, we can ensure a level playing field for all market participants and maintain the competitive nature of the free market. This, in turn, benefits both consumers and smaller businesses.</div>

I disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. While I understand that life is precious and should be protected, I believe that the decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal and complex one that should be left to the woman and her healthcare provider.

In some cases, an unwanted pregnancy can have severe emotional, physical, and financial consequences for the woman. By making abortion illegal in all circumstances, we are not only disregarding the woman&#x27;s autonomy but also potentially forcing her into dangerous and life-threatening situations.

Moreover, criminalizing abortion does not eliminate the practice; it only drives it underground, making it more dangerous and less safe for the woman. Instead, we should focus on providing comprehensive sex education, accessible contraceptives, and support for women who choose to continue their pregnancies. This approach would help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and</div>

I agree with the statement that all authority should be questioned because questioning authority is essential for maintaining a healthy and democratic society.

While the phrase &quot;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; is often used to emphasize the importance of retribution or equal punishment, I disagree with this approach.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis. This is because it is important for these cultural institutions to be financially sustainable and competitive in the market. By relying on taxpayers to support them, it may lead to inefficiencies and misallocation of resources.

Moreover, it is essential for these institutions to adapt to the market demands and evolve to stay relevant and sustainable. If they cannot survive on a commercial basis, it might indicate that they are not meeting the needs or expectations of their audience, which could be a sign of a lack of innovation or relevance.

In conclusion, I believe that it is crucial for theatres and museums to be self-sufficient and competitive in the market, and taxpayers should not be expected to support those that cannot survive on a commercial basis.</div>

I strongly agree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. While I understand the importance of attending classes for learning and socialization, I believe that education should be more focused on the quality of learning rather than the quantity of time spent in the classroom.

In today&#x27;s world, there are various ways to access knowledge and develop skills outside of traditional classroom settings. Online courses, self-study, and project-based learning are just a few examples of alternative learning methods that can be equally effective. By making attendance compulsory, schools may inadvertently discourage students from exploring these alternative learning opportunities.

Moreover, mandatory attendance can create a negative association with learning for students who struggle with attendance due to personal or health reasons. This can lead to a vicious cycle of absenteeism and low motivation. Instead, schools should focus on creating an environment where students feel motivated to learn and engage with the material,</div>

While I understand that some parents may believe that spanking is an effective way to discipline their children, I personally disagree with the statement. There are numerous alternative methods of discipline that can be more effective and less harmful to the child&#x27;s emotional and physical well-being. Spanking can lead to long-term negative effects on a child&#x27;s mental health and self-esteem, and it may not even be an effective way to teach the desired lesson.

I agree with the statement that it&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents. This is because children, like all individuals, have the right to privacy and personal space. They may have thoughts, feelings, or experiences that they might not feel comfortable sharing with their parents. Additionally, children may also keep secrets to maintain a sense of independence or to protect their parents from worry or disappointment.

I disagree with the statement because it oversimplifies a complex issue and does not take into account the various factors that contribute to the well-being of individuals and society as a whole. People with inheritable disabilities have the same right to love, form relationships, and start families as anyone else.

Furthermore, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of such a policy. Preventing people with disabilities from reproducing could lead to a lack of representation and understanding of their needs in society. It could also stigmatize and marginalize them further.

I strongly disagree with the statement that first-generation immigrants can never be fully integrated within their new country.

Integration is a dynamic process that involves learning the language, understanding and adapting to the culture, and participating in the social, economic, and political life of the new country. It is essential to recognize that integration is a two-way process, and the host country also has a role to play in making newcomers feel welcome and included.

Moreover, the concept of integration is subjective and can vary from person to person. What may seem like full integration for one individual might not be the same for another.

I disagree with the statement that the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes. While I understand the argument that it may serve as a deterrent and provide justice for the victims&#x27; families, I believe there are several reasons why it is not the most effective or ethical solution.

Firstly, the death penalty is irreversible, and there have been numerous cases of wrongful convictions. This means that innocent people have been executed, which is a grave injustice.

Secondly, the death penalty is not a deterrent. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not significantly reduce crime rates compared to states without the death penalty.

Thirdly, the death penalty is expensive. The costs associated with the legal process, appeals, and executions are much higher than those of life imprisonment without parole.

Lastly, the death penalty disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly people</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement because it promotes a hierarchical and authoritarian view of society, which can lead to oppression and inequality. In a civilized society, people should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their position in a social hierarchy. A more democratic and egalitarian approach to social organization is more conducive to fostering a sense of community, cooperation, and mutual respect.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement that abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything shouldn&#x27;t be considered art at all. Art is a subjective form of expression, and it can take many forms, including abstract art. Abstract art often aims to evoke emotions, convey ideas, or create a visual experience that goes beyond literal representation. It is up to the viewer to interpret and appreciate the art in their own way. By limiting the definition of art to only representational pieces, we would be excluding a vast range of artistic expressions that have significant value and meaning.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice. While punishment serves as a deterrent and holds offenders accountable for their actions, rehabilitation aims to address the root causes of criminal behavior and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. By focusing on both punishment and rehabilitation, the criminal justice system can better serve the interests of public safety and the rehabilitation of offenders.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While I understand that some criminals may be beyond rehabilitation, I believe that it is still important to try and rehabilitate as many criminals as possible. Rehabilitation programs can help reduce recidivism rates and contribute to a safer society. It is crucial to provide opportunities for personal growth and development, even for those who may have committed heinous crimes. By offering rehabilitation, we can give criminals a chance to change their lives and become productive members of society. However, it is essential to recognize that not all criminals can be rehabilitated, and in such cases, society must ensure proper security measures are in place to protect the public.</div>

I disagree with the statement because the importance of individuals and their roles varies depending on the context and the perspective one takes. While businesspeople and manufacturers play crucial roles in the economy and production of goods, writers and artists contribute significantly to the cultural, intellectual, and emotional well-being of society. Both groups are essential, and their importance should not be compared in a hierarchical manner.</div>

The role of a mother is multifaceted, and it is not limited to just homemaking.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement because it highlights the tension between the pursuit of economic growth and the need to address climate change. While economic growth is important for improving living standards and reducing poverty, it often comes at the expense of increased greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Climate science has made it clear that we need to transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy to mitigate the worst impacts of global warming. Therefore, it is crucial for politicians to balance economic growth with environmental concerns and prioritize sustainable development.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

I agree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. As individuals grow and develop, they often come to understand that the world is not solely composed of their personal experiences and perspectives. They learn to navigate and coexist with the systems and institutions that govern their society. This process of acceptance and cooperation with the establishment can be seen as a sign of maturity, as it demonstrates an ability to adapt and work within the existing frameworks. However, it&#x27;s essential to note that this doesn&#x27;t mean blindly accepting everything without question or criticism, but rather finding a balance between personal beliefs and the realities of the world.</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things. Astrology is a pseudoscience that relies on the positions of celestial bodies to make predictions or draw conclusions about human affairs and terrestrial events. There is no scientific evidence to support the claims made by astrology, and it does not follow the scientific method. Therefore, I believe that astrology does not accurately explain anything.</div>

I disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. While religion can provide a framework for moral guidance and teachings, it is not a requirement for being moral.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While both charity and social security serve important roles in helping the disadvantaged, I disagree that one is inherently better than the other. Charity is often more flexible and can respond quickly to emergencies or specific needs. However, it can also be less reliable and inconsistent due to fluctuations in donations.

Social security, on the other hand, provides a stable and predictable source of income for those who qualify. It ensures a basic level of support for those who are genuinely disadvantaged, regardless of their ability to receive charitable donations.

In conclusion, both charity and social security have their strengths and weaknesses, and it&#x27;s essential to have a combination of both to effectively support the disadvantaged.</div>

I believe that some people may have a tendency to experience more bad luck or unfortunate events in their lives compared to others.

I believe that instilling religious values in children can have a positive impact on their character development and moral compass. While it&#x27;s essential to respect different beliefs and values, I think that incorporating religious values in a school setting can help students understand the importance of empathy, compassion, and respect for others.

I disagree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral. While some people and cultures may hold this belief, it is important to recognize that morality is subjective and can vary greatly between individuals and societies.

I strongly agree with the statement that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption. Adoption is about providing a safe, nurturing, and loving home for a child in need, regardless of the sexual orientation of the prospective parents. As long as the couple can provide a stable and loving environment, they should have the same opportunity to adopt as any other couple. Excluding them would be discriminatory and unjust.</div>

I agree with the statement that pornography, depicting consenting adults, should be legal for the adult population. This is because it aligns with the principles of freedom of expression and personal autonomy. As long as the content is created and consumed by consenting adults, it should be legal. It is essential to note that this does not condone or support non-consensual or exploitative content. The focus is on the legality of adult-oriented content between consenting adults.</div>

I strongly disagree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. Sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human identity, and it is not a choice. Research in the field of psychology and neuroscience has shown that sexual orientation is influenced by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors.
