I agree with the statement because I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

Economic globalisation is a process of increasing economic interdependence and integration between countries, driven by factors such as trade, investment, and technology. While it has brought many benefits, such as increased trade and investment, it has also led to increased inequality and exploitation of workers in developing countries.

Trans-national corporations, or TNCs, are large multinational companies that operate across multiple countries. They have been a major driver of economic globalisation, but they have also been accused of exploiting workers and the environment in developing countries. For example, TNCs have been accused of using cheap labour in developing countries to produce goods at a lower cost, which can lead to lower wages and poor working conditions for workers.

In contrast, economic globalisation should primarily serve</div>

I agree with this statement because I believe that class is a more important factor in dividing people than nationality. Class is a social construct that is based on economic status, while nationality is a more fixed concept that is based on geography and culture. Class is a more fluid concept that can change over time, while nationality is a more fixed concept that is often passed down from generation to generation. Additionally, class is often a more significant factor in determining a person&#x27;s access to resources, opportunities, and social mobility, while nationality is more of a cultural and political identity.

I agree with this statement because I believe that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.

Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is a measure of the rate of inflation, which is the annual rate of increase in a price index.

Inflation can be caused by a number of factors, including an increase in the money supply, a decrease in the value of the currency, or an increase in the cost of production.

Inflation can have a number of negative effects on an economy. It can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, which can lead to a decrease in the standard of living. It can also lead to a decrease in the value of savings, which can lead to a decrease in the amount of money available for investment.

I agree with this statement because I believe that land should not be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a natural resource that should be protected and preserved for future generations. It is a source of food, water, and other resources that are essential for human survival. When land is treated as a commodity, it can be exploited and depleted, leading to environmental degradation and social injustice.
Land ownership should be based on the principle of stewardship, where individuals and communities are responsible for managing and conserving the land for the benefit of all. This approach recognizes the interdependence between humans and the natural world and promotes sustainable land use practices.
In conclusion, land should not be a commodity to be bought and sold. It should be managed and conserved for the benefit of all, now and in the future.

    <div class="pre">P

Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.

Protectionism is the practice of protecting domestic industry against foreign competition by means of tariffs, subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions.

Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it can help to protect domestic industries from unfair competition from foreign companies. For example, if a foreign company is dumping products in the domestic market at a price that is below the cost of production, this can put domestic companies at a disadvantage and lead to job losses. In such cases, protectionist measures can be used to level the playing field and prevent the domestic industry from being harmed.

However, protectionism can also have negative consequences. For example, it can lead to higher prices for consumers, as well as reduced competition and innovation. It can also lead to trade disputes and retaliatory measures, which can harm both the domestic and foreign economies</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with this statement because I believe that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. This is because the primary goal of a company is to generate profits for its shareholders, and this is what drives the company&#x27;s success. By focusing on delivering profits to its shareholders, a company can ensure that it is able to continue to operate and grow, which in turn benefits society as a whole.
Additionally, I believe that a company&#x27;s social responsibility should be limited to its own operations and not extend to broader social issues. This is because a company&#x27;s primary responsibility is to its shareholders, and it is not the responsibility of the company to address broader social issues. By focusing on its own operations, a company can ensure that it is able to deliver the best possible products and services to its customers, which in turn benefits society as a whole.

I agree with this statement because I believe that businesses should be held accountable for their actions. If a business is found to be misleading the public, they should be penalised in some way. This could be in the form of a fine, or even a ban from operating.

I think that this is important because it helps to protect consumers. If businesses are not held accountable for their actions, they may continue to mislead the public and cause harm. This could lead to people making bad decisions, or even being scammed.

I also think that this is important because it helps to maintain trust in the business community. If businesses are not held accountable for their actions, people may start to lose faith in them. This could lead to people being less likely to do business with them, which could hurt the economy.

I believe that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies because it is important to ensure that there is competition in the market and that consumers have a choice. Predator multinationals can use their size and power to create monopolies, which can lead to higher prices, lower quality products, and a lack of innovation.

I agree with this statement because I believe that first-generation immigrants can never be fully integrated within their new country. This is because they are often faced with a number of challenges that make it difficult for them to fully assimilate into the culture and society of their new country.
Firstly, language barriers can be a significant obstacle for first-generation immigrants. Many immigrants come from countries where English is not the primary language, and they may struggle to communicate effectively in their new environment. This can make it difficult for them to participate fully in social and economic activities, as well as to access important services such as healthcare and education.
Secondly, cultural differences can also be a challenge for first-generation immigrants. Many immigrants come from countries with different values, customs, and traditions, and they may find it difficult to adapt to the new culture of their new country. This can lead</div>

I agree with this statement because I believe that public funding is necessary for the survival of independent broadcasting institutions.

I believe that public funding is necessary for the survival of independent broadcasting institutions because it allows them to produce content that is not influenced by commercial interests. This is important because it allows them to provide a diverse range of perspectives and opinions, which is essential for a healthy democracy.

Additionally, public funding allows independent broadcasting institutions to produce content that is not influenced by advertisers. This is important because it allows them to produce content that is not biased towards certain products or services, which is essential for a healthy democracy.

    <div class="pre">P

I agree with this statement because a one-party state is a system where the government is controlled by a single political party. This type of government is often associated with authoritarian or totalitarian regimes, where the ruling party has complete control over the political system and the people.
In a one-party state, the government is not accountable to the people, as there is no opposition party to provide a check on the power of the ruling party. This can lead to a lack of political freedom and the suppression of dissent.
However, a one-party state can also have some advantages. For example, it can be more efficient and effective in implementing policies and programs, as there is no need for lengthy debates and negotiations between different political parties.
In conclusion, while a one-party state can have some advantages, it also has significant disadvantages, such as a lack of political freedom and the suppression of dissent</div>

I also believe that the death penalty is a just punishment for the most serious crimes. I believe that if a person commits a crime that is so heinous that they deserve to be put to death, then they should be put to death.

I believe that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation because it is the only way to ensure that the criminal will not commit the crime again. If the criminal is not punished, then they will not learn their lesson and will continue to commit crimes.

Punishment is also important because it deters other criminals from committing crimes. If criminals know that they will be punished severely for their crimes, then they are less likely to commit those crimes.

Finally, punishment is important because it helps to restore order in society. When criminals are punished, it sends a message to the rest of society that crime will not be tolerated. This helps to create a safer and more orderly society.

Charity is a more personal and direct way of helping those in need, as it allows individuals to choose who and how to help. It also allows for more flexibility in terms of the type of help provided, as well as the amount of help given. Additionally, charity can be more cost-effective than social security, as it does not require the same level of bureaucracy and administration. Finally, charity can be more rewarding for both the giver and the receiver, as it allows for a more personal connection and a sense of satisfaction in helping others.

I agree with this statement because I believe that some people are naturally unlucky. I think that this is because some people are just born with bad luck. For example, if someone is born into a family that is poor, they may not have the same opportunities as someone who is born into a wealthy family. This can lead to them being unlucky in life.

Another reason why I think some people are naturally unlucky is because of their personality. For example, if someone is a pessimist, they may see the world as a negative place and this can lead to them being unlucky. On the other hand, if someone is an optimist, they may see the world as a positive place and this can lead to them being lucky.

Finally, I think that some people are naturally unlucky because of their circumstances. For example, if someone is born into a war-torn country, they</div>
