    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with the statement that if economic globalization is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

Economic globalization, which refers to the increasing interconnectedness of economies around the world, has brought about numerous benefits such as increased trade, investment, and cultural exchange. However, it has also raised concerns about its potential negative impacts, particularly on the most vulnerable populations and the environment.

Trans-national corporations, which are often the driving force behind economic globalization, have been criticized for prioritizing their own profits over the well-being of people and the planet. This can lead to exploitative labor practices, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation.

Therefore, it is essential that economic globalization serves the interests of humanity rather than just trans-national corporations. This can be achieved through policies and regulations that promote social and environmental sustainability, protect human rights,</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement. While it&#x27;s natural and important to have a sense of patriotism and loyalty to one&#x27;s country, it&#x27;s also crucial to uphold values such as truth, justice, and morality. Supporting one&#x27;s country blindly, regardless of its actions, can lead to condoning unethical or immoral behavior. It&#x27;s essential to hold our countries accountable for their actions and encourage them to make the right choices.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement. While it&#x27;s true that no one has a choice in where they are born, being proud of one&#x27;s country is not foolish. A person&#x27;s country of birth shapes their identity, culture, and experiences in significant ways. It&#x27;s natural to feel a sense of attachment and pride for the community and values that have influenced their life. Additionally, being proud of one&#x27;s country does not mean being closed-minded or dismissive of other cultures. It&#x27;s possible to appreciate and celebrate the unique aspects of one&#x27;s own country while also respecting and learning from the diversity of other cultures.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that &quot;Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races.&quot; This statement is based on a flawed and harmful assumption. All human beings possess unique qualities and strengths, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. It is essential to recognize and celebrate the diversity that makes up the human race rather than making baseless and divisive claims about superiority.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend.&quot; This is a common proverb that reflects the idea of strategic alliances, where two parties come together despite their fundamental differences, to counteract a common enemy or threat. This approach is often used in politics, diplomacy, and business to achieve mutual goals or gain an advantage over a greater adversary. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this strategy should be used with caution and careful consideration, as it can lead to unintended consequences or long-term negative consequences if the alliance is not genuine or if the common enemy is no longer a threat.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law is designed to promote peace, protect human rights, and maintain order in the global community. Military action that violates international law undermines these goals and can lead to further conflict and instability. While there may be circumstances where the use of force appears necessary, it is important that such actions be taken in accordance with international law and with the authorization of the United Nations or other recognized international bodies.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. In today&#x27;s world, there is a significant overlap between information and entertainment. News outlets often use sensationalism and drama to capture audiences, while entertainment programs frequently cover current events. Social media platforms have further blurred the lines between the two, with people sharing both personal updates and news articles. This fusion can make it challenging for individuals to distinguish between fact and fiction, and can potentially lead to the spread of misinformation.</div>

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. While class can be a significant source of division and conflict, nationality remains a powerful and often more prominent factor in shaping people&#x27;s identities and allegiances. Nationality is often associated with shared history, language, culture, and political institutions, which can create strong bonds among people and lead to conflicts with those from other nations. Class, on the other hand, is a socio-economic construct that can cut across national boundaries and unite people from different nations who share similar economic circumstances. However, it is important to note that the relationship between class and nationality can be complex, and the two can intersect in various ways to shape people&#x27;s experiences and perspectives.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. While inflation can have negative effects on an economy, such as reducing purchasing power and increasing the cost of living, unemployment also has significant negative consequences, including decreased consumer spending, increased poverty, and social unrest. Both inflation and unemployment are important economic indicators, and addressing both is crucial for maintaining a healthy economy. The relative importance of each issue may depend on the specific circumstances of an economy, but neither should be disregarded in favor of the other.</div>

Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. Corporations have a primary responsibility to maximize profits for their shareholders, and this can sometimes come at the expense of the environment. Without regulation, there may be little incentive for corporations to invest in environmentally friendly practices or to limit their negative impact on the environment. Regulation provides a framework for enforcing environmental standards and holding corporations accountable for their actions.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&quot; This is a fundamental principle of socialism and communism, and it is based on the idea of equality and fairness. It recognizes that everyone has different abilities and resources, and that everyone has different needs. By contributing according to one&#x27;s ability and receiving according to one&#x27;s needs, we can create a society where everyone is taken care of and no one is left behind. This principle can help reduce poverty, inequality, and social unrest, and it can promote social cohesion and solidarity. However, it is important to note that implementing this principle in practice can be challenging, and it requires a strong commitment to social justice and collective responsibility.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that &quot;The freer the market, the freer the people.&quot; A free market economy allows individuals to make their own choices about what to buy, sell, and produce. This freedom to engage in economic activity can lead to greater personal freedom and autonomy. However, it is important to note that a free market does not necessarily mean the absence of regulation or government intervention. A balanced approach that ensures fair competition and protects consumers and workers is essential for maintaining a truly free market.</div>

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

The fact that many people in developed countries buy bottled water as a consumer product is a reflection of various societal issues, such as mistrust in the quality of tap water, convenience, and marketing. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this issue is not limited to developed countries, as many people around the world lack access to clean drinking water, making it a significant challenge for their daily lives. The commodification of water as a consumer product can be seen as a sad reflection of our society&#x27;s priorities and values.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a vital resource that is essential for the survival and well-being of all living beings. Treating it as a commodity to be bought and sold can lead to its exploitation, degradation, and unequal distribution. It is important that we recognize the intrinsic value of land and work towards ensuring that it is managed in a sustainable and equitable manner for the benefit of present and future generations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

There are indeed individuals who amass great wealth through manipulating money, often through financial schemes, speculation, or other unproductive means. While some may argue that such activities contribute to economic growth, it is also true that they often do not create value for society in the way that productive industries or services do. Furthermore, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few can exacerbate social and economic inequality, undermining the fabric of society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to government policies that shield domestic industries from foreign competition. While free trade is generally beneficial for economic growth, there are certain circumstances where protectionism can be justified. For instance, when a domestic industry is new and not yet competitive, or when a foreign industry engages in unfair trade practices such as dumping or subsidies, protectionism can help the domestic industry develop and protect jobs. However, it is important to note that excessive protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, higher prices for consumers, and reduced economic growth. Therefore, protectionism should be used judiciously and with caution.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While maximizing profits is an important aspect of running a business, companies also have obligations to various stakeholders including employees, customers, communities, and the environment. These responsibilities extend beyond just financial performance and can include ethical business practices, fair labor standards, product safety, and environmental sustainability. Ignoring these responsibilities can lead to negative consequences for the company and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important for companies to balance their financial goals with their social responsibilities.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it&#x27;s true that high-income individuals pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes than lower-income individuals, the overall tax rate for the rich is still lower than many people believe. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1% of earners pay about 38% of their income in federal taxes, while the bottom 20% pay only 2% or less. While some may argue that this is not enough, it is important to note that taxes fund essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which benefit everyone in society, including the rich. Additionally, there are various tax loopholes and exemptions that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which further reduces their effective tax rate. Therefore, I believe that the rich are not overtaxed, but rather that the tax system could be made more fair and progressive by closing these looph</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because in many healthcare systems, resources are limited, and those who can afford to pay for better care are often able to access it more easily. This can lead to better health outcomes for those who can afford it, which can in turn lead to greater productivity and overall societal benefits. However, it is important to note that access to healthcare should not be based solely on an individual&#x27;s ability to pay, and efforts should be made to ensure that everyone has access to at least a basic level of care.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I strongly agree that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.

Monopolies occur when a single firm has complete market power, meaning they are the only supplier of a good or service in that market. This can lead to several negative consequences, such as higher prices for consumers, reduced innovation, and a lack of competition. Predator multinationals, which are large and powerful corporations, have the resources and incentives to attempt to create monopolies by acquiring competitors or using their market power to suppress competition.

Restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies are necessary to maintain a free and competitive market. Antitrust laws and regulations are designed to prevent monopolies and promote competition. These laws and regulations can take various forms, such as prohibiting mergers and acquisitions that would reduce competition, enforcing fair trade practices, and breaking up</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. I believe that women should have the right to make decisions regarding their own bodies and reproductive health. While there are valid ethical and moral considerations surrounding abortion, ultimately, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of individual circumstances and personal autonomy. In cases where the woman&#x27;s life is not at risk, I believe that the decision to have an abortion should be left up to the woman and her healthcare provider.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that all authority should be questioned. This is because questioning authority can lead to important discoveries, improvements, and progress. It allows us to challenge outdated beliefs and practices, and to hold those in power accountable for their actions. However, it&#x27;s important to note that this doesn&#x27;t mean that we should blindly distrust or disrespect all forms of authority. Instead, we should approach questioning with a critical and open mind, and be willing to consider the evidence and arguments on both sides.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; being a just solution in all cases. This is an ancient principle of &quot;lex talionis&quot; or &quot;law of retaliation,&quot; which suggests that the punishment should fit the crime. While it may seem fair at first glance, it can lead to a cycle of violence and revenge, rather than promoting forgiveness and reconciliation. In modern legal systems, the focus is on rehabilitation and deterrence, rather than retaliation. Additionally, the principle does not take into account the intent or circumstances of the crime, and can result in disproportionate punishments.</div>

While it is important for these institutions to generate revenue through ticket sales and other commercial activities, they also provide significant cultural, educational, and social benefits to the community. In many cases, they may not be able to charge sufficient prices to cover their costs due to their mission-driven mandate or the nature of their audience. Providing public funding to support these institutions can help ensure their long-term viability and accessibility to all members of the community.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. Here&#x27;s why:

Attendance in school is crucial for students to learn and grow academically, socially, and emotionally. Regular attendance helps students stay on track with their studies, build relationships with their peers and teachers, and develop important skills like punctuality and responsibility.

Moreover, schools have a responsibility to provide a safe and productive learning environment for students. Making attendance compulsory ensures that students are present in the classroom to take advantage of the educational opportunities provided by the school.

Additionally, research shows that attendance is linked to academic achievement. Students who attend school regularly are more likely to perform better academically than those who miss classes frequently.

In conclusion, I believe that schools should make attendance compulsory to ensure that students receive a quality education and are able to reach their full potential.</div>

The statement implies that it is better for society if different groups of people segregate themselves from one another. This is a harmful and divisive viewpoint. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other characteristic, have the right to live and interact with others in a free and equal manner. Segregation and discrimination only serve to perpetuate inequality and injustice. It is essential that we strive for a society where all individuals are valued and respected, and where everyone has the opportunity to live and work together in harmony.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it is a common practice in some cultures and families, there are more effective and healthy ways to discipline children that do not involve physical violence. Spanking can lead to negative outcomes such as increased aggression, fear, and even physical harm. Instead, good parents use positive reinforcement, clear communication, and consistent consequences to help their children learn appropriate behavior.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement: It&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents.

Children are individuals with their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. As they grow and develop, they learn to navigate the world around them and form their own identities. Keeping some secrets from parents is a normal part of this process. It allows children to assert their independence and privacy, build trust, and learn important social skills like communication and conflict resolution. However, it&#x27;s important for parents to maintain an open and supportive relationship with their children, and to encourage open and honest communication whenever possible.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offense. I believe that the resources of law enforcement agencies could be better utilized than enforcing marijuana laws, especially when it comes to personal use. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the harms associated with marijuana use are generally less severe than those associated with alcohol or tobacco use, and that marijuana is less addictive than these substances. Additionally, many jurisdictions have decriminalized or even legalized marijuana for personal use, with positive results in terms of reduced crime rates, increased tax revenues, and improved public health outcomes. Ultimately, I believe that adults should be free to make their own choices about what they put into their bodies, as long as they are not harming others.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs. While it is important for education to prepare students for the workforce, I believe that the primary role of schooling is to provide a well-rounded education that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and a love for learning. These skills are essential for personal growth and success in all areas of life, not just in the context of employment. Additionally, the job market is constantly evolving, and it is impossible for schools to predict and prepare students for every possible career path. Therefore, it is more beneficial for students to develop a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that they can build upon throughout their lives, rather than being overly focused on specific job training.</div>

It is important to remember that people with disabilities have the same fundamental human rights as everyone else, including the right to start a family if they choose to do so. Additionally, advances in medical technology and support services can help mitigate the impact of many inheritable disabilities, allowing individuals to live fulfilling and productive lives. Ultimately, it is not for society to make decisions about who can or cannot reproduce based on perceived notions of &quot;fitness&quot; or &quot;worthiness.&quot;</div>

1. Social skills: Children need to learn how to interact with others, communicate effectively, and build healthy relationships.

Public funding for broadcasting institutions can help ensure that a diverse range of voices and perspectives are represented in media, particularly for those that may not be commercially viable. It can also help to maintain the independence of these institutions from commercial pressures and political interference. Additionally, public funding can help to provide essential services, such as emergency alerts and educational programming, to the public.

For example, mass surveillance programs, such as those revealed by Edward Snowden, have raised concerns about the potential for abuse and the chilling effect on free expression.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that abstract art that doesn&#x27;t represent anything shouldn&#x27;t be considered art at all. Art is a form of expression and communication, and abstract art is a valid way for artists to convey emotions, ideas, and experiences that may not be easily represented through traditional representational art. The beauty of art lies in its ability to evoke different responses and meanings from each viewer, and abstract art offers a unique opportunity for this kind of open-ended interpretation.</div>

In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice.

While it is important to hold individuals accountable for their actions through punishment, the ultimate goal of the criminal justice system should be to prevent recidivism and promote public safety. Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in achieving this goal by addressing the underlying causes of criminal behavior and helping individuals develop the skills and resources they need to reintegrate into society and lead productive lives.

Furthermore, focusing solely on punishment can have negative consequences, such as increasing the likelihood of recidivism and perpetuating cycles of violence and crime. By prioritizing rehabilitation, we can create a more just and effective criminal justice system that not only punishes offenders but also helps them become productive members of society.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the criminal justice system, and it has been shown to reduce recidivism rates and improve public safety. While not all criminals can be rehabilitated, many can benefit from programs and interventions designed to address the root causes of their criminal behavior. Additionally, rehabilitation is often more cost-effective in the long run than continuously incarcerating individuals who are likely to reoffend.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the businessperson and the manufacturer are more important than the writer and the artist. While both the businessperson and the manufacturer contribute significantly to the economy and society, the role of the writer and the artist is essential for the preservation and advancement of culture, knowledge, and creativity. The arts and literature provide meaning, inspiration, and a deeper understanding of the human condition, and they contribute to the development of critical thinking and empathy. Therefore, the importance of the writer and the artist should not be underestimated.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that &quot;growth is detrimental to our efforts to curb global warming&quot; for all politicians and situations. While it&#x27;s true that economic growth can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, it&#x27;s important to recognize that not all economic growth is created equal. Sustainable economic growth, which prioritizes renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other environmentally-friendly practices, can actually help reduce global warming. Additionally, economic growth can lead to increased resources to invest in climate solutions and create jobs in the clean energy sector. It&#x27;s essential for politicians to find a balance between economic growth and addressing climate change, rather than viewing them as mutually exclusive.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. While it may be easier to conform to societal norms and expectations, true maturity comes from being able to think critically and independently, and not being afraid to challenge the status quo when necessary. Making peace with the establishment can mean giving up on one&#x27;s values and principles, and I believe that personal growth and development require staying true to oneself.</div>

Astrology is based on the belief that the positions and movements of celestial bodies can influence human affairs and personality traits.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. Morality is a set of principles that governs behavior and is concerned with maintaining standards of right and wrong. Religion, on the other hand, is a set of beliefs and practices related to the worship of a god or gods. While many religious traditions provide a moral framework, morality can also be based on secular principles, such as human rights, reason, or empathy. People can be moral without being religious, and there are many examples throughout history of moral individuals and societies that were not religious. Additionally, there are many religious people who do not follow the moral teachings of their faith, and there are many non-religious people who live moral lives. Morality and religion are related but distinct concepts.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While charity can provide important resources and support for individuals in need, it is not a reliable or consistent source of assistance. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-funded program that provides a safety net for people who are unable to work or who are experiencing financial hardship due to old age, disability, or other reasons. Social security benefits are guaranteed and regular, whereas charity is often dependent on the generosity and availability of donors. Additionally, social security benefits are often more comprehensive and cover a wider range of needs than charity alone can provide. Therefore, I believe that social security is a more effective and reliable means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged than charity alone.</div>

Morality is a subjective concept that varies greatly from person to person, culture to culture, and religion to religion. Some people believe that sex outside of marriage is immoral, while others do not. It is important to respect each individual&#x27;s right to their own beliefs and values, as long as they are not harming others.

Additionally, the production and consumption of pornography is a significant industry and a part of human sexual expression and exploration.
