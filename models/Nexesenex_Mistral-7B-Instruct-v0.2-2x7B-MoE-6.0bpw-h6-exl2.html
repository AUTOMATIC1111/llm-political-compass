    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that if economic globalization is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Economic globalization can bring about numerous benefits such as increased trade, economic growth, and cultural exchange. However, it is essential that the process is equitable and just, and the interests of humanity as a whole are prioritized over the interests of corporations. This can be achieved through policies that promote social and environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, and economic development that benefits all members of society, not just the wealthy and powerful.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement. While it&#x27;s natural to have loyalty and love for one&#x27;s country, blindly supporting it without considering whether it&#x27;s right or wrong can lead to harmful consequences. It&#x27;s essential to hold our countries accountable for their actions and promote positive change when necessary.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement. While it&#x27;s true that no one has a choice in where they are born, it doesn&#x27;t make it foolish to be proud of one&#x27;s country. National pride can stem from various reasons such as cultural heritage, personal experiences, and achievements of the country. It&#x27;s a source of identity and connection for many people. Being proud of one&#x27;s country doesn&#x27;t mean disregarding or being dismissive of other countries or their people.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that &quot;Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races.&quot; This statement is based on a flawed and harmful belief system that promotes racial superiority and discrimination. All human beings possess unique qualities and strengths, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is essential to recognize and celebrate the diversity and interconnectedness of the human race, rather than creating divisions and hierarchies based on race.</div>

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

    <div class="pre">P. This proverb, also known as the &quot;enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; principle, suggests that in certain situations, it may be advantageous for two parties to form an alliance against a common enemy, even if they have conflicting interests or are ideologically opposed to each other under normal circumstances. While this principle is not always applicable and can lead to unintended consequences, it has been used effectively in various contexts throughout history. For instance, during wartime, two adversaries might form an alliance against a greater threat, or in business negotiations, two competitors might join forces to take on a common rival. Ultimately, the principle acknowledges that temporary alliances can be formed based on shared adversity, and can sometimes lead to unexpected benefits or opportunities.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified. International law is an essential framework for maintaining peace, stability, and respect for human rights. Military action that violates international law undermines this framework and can lead to further conflict and instability. While there may be situations where military action is necessary, it should be taken in accordance with international law to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. With the rise of social media, streaming services, and other forms of digital media, it can be difficult to distinguish between content that is meant to inform and content that is meant to entertain. This blurring of lines can lead to misinformation, confusion, and a lack of trust in the media. Additionally, the constant availability of entertainment can make it difficult for people to focus on important information or to engage with news and current events in a meaningful way.</div>

    <span class="qlabel">Question: classthannationality</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. While class can be a significant source of division, nationality remains a powerful factor in shaping people&#x27;s identities and allegiances. Nationality is often associated with cultural traditions, language, history, and shared experiences that can create strong bonds among people. Additionally, nationality can influence economic opportunities, access to resources, and political power dynamics, which can exacerbate class divisions. However, nationality and class are not mutually exclusive, and they can intersect in complex ways to shape people&#x27;s experiences and social dynamics. Ultimately, both class and nationality can be sources of division, and it is essential to recognize the complex ways in which they intersect and influence each other.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. While keeping inflation in check is important for economic stability, high unemployment can have serious social and economic consequences as well. Both inflation and unemployment are important economic indicators, and addressing both is crucial for a healthy economy.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that corporations cannot be fully trusted to voluntarily protect the environment and that they require regulation. While some corporations may prioritize environmental sustainability, others may prioritize profits over the environment. Regulations provide a framework for enforcing environmental standards and holding corporations accountable for their environmental impact.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; as a fundamental idea. This concept, known as &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs&quot; or &quot;from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs,&quot; is a core principle of socialism and communism. It emphasizes the importance of community and mutual support, where individuals contribute based on their abilities and resources, and the community ensures that everyone&#x27;s basic needs are met. This idea promotes equality, fairness, and social cohesion. However, it&#x27;s important to note that the practical implementation of this principle can be complex and challenging, and there are various interpretations and criticisms of it.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that the freer the market, the freer the people, to a certain extent. A free market allows individuals to make their own choices about what to buy, sell, and produce, which can lead to greater individual freedom and economic opportunity. However, it&#x27;s important to note that a free market does not necessarily mean a completely unregulated market. Some regulations are necessary to protect consumers, ensure fair competition, and prevent market failures. Additionally, a free market does not automatically lead to equal opportunities or outcomes for all individuals, and other social and economic factors can limit people&#x27;s freedom and opportunities regardless of the state of the market.</div>

It&#x27;s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement.

The fact that bottled water has become a consumer product, with various brands and marketing campaigns, is a reflection of the perceived lack of trust in the quality and safety of tap water in many places. This is a sad reflection on our society, as access to clean drinking water should be a basic human right, not a commodity to be bought and sold.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. I strongly agree with the statement that land shouldn&#x27;t be a commodity to be bought and sold. Land is a finite resource that is essential for all life, and treating it as a commodity can lead to exploitation, inequality, and environmental degradation. By recognizing the intrinsic value of land and treating it as a common good, we can ensure that it is used in a sustainable and equitable way for the benefit of all members of society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement. There are individuals who amass great wealth through various means, including manipulating money, without contributing significantly to their society. While some may argue that their wealth creation benefits society through job creation or investment, there are also those who hoard their wealth and do not contribute meaningfully to the betterment of their communities.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to government policies that shield domestic industries from foreign competition. While free trade is generally beneficial for economic growth, there are certain situations where protectionism can be justified. For instance, when a domestic industry is still developing and cannot compete with more established foreign competitors, protectionist measures can help the industry grow and become more competitive. Additionally, in cases where national security is at stake, protectionism can be used to prevent the importation of potentially harmful goods or technologies. However, it&#x27;s important to note that protectionism can also have negative consequences, such as higher prices for consumers and reduced economic efficiency. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and only when necessary.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. While maximizing profits is an important aspect of running a business, companies also have responsibilities to other stakeholders such as employees, customers, and the community in which they operate. These responsibilities can include providing fair wages and safe working conditions for employees, producing high-quality products for customers, and contributing positively to the community through philanthropy or sustainable business practices. Ignoring these responsibilities in pursuit of profits alone can lead to negative consequences for all stakeholders and ultimately harm the long-term success of the business.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it is true that high net worth individuals and corporations may pay a larger absolute dollar amount in taxes, they typically pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes compared to middle and low-income individuals. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the top 1% of taxpayers paid an average of 24.2% of their income in federal taxes in 2018, while the bottom 50% paid an average of 14.6%. Therefore, I believe that the rich are not overtaxed relative to their income.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because in many healthcare systems, resources are limited, and those who can afford to pay for better care are able to access it. This can lead to better health outcomes for those who can afford it, which can contribute to health disparities between those with means and those without. However, it is important to note that access to healthcare should not be solely based on one&#x27;s ability to pay, and efforts should be made to ensure that everyone has access to basic healthcare services.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public. Misleading the public is an unethical business practice that can harm consumers and undermine trust in businesses and markets. Penalising such businesses can serve as a deterrent and encourage businesses to act ethically.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies are necessary in a genuine free market. While the concept of a free market implies minimal government intervention, it does not mean an absence of regulations. Monopolies can stifle competition, limit consumer choice, and distort market prices. Therefore, regulations that prevent monopolies from forming or being maintained are essential to ensure a level playing field and promote a truly competitive market.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal when the woman&#x27;s life is not threatened. I believe that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health. Abortion is a complex issue with many factors to consider, and it is not my place to impose my beliefs on others. The decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one that should be left up to the individual, in consultation with their healthcare provider and their support network. Additionally, there are many reasons why a woman may seek an abortion, and it is not always a simple or easy decision. Ultimately, I believe that women should have the autonomy to make informed decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health, and that the government should not interfere in these private matters.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that all authority should be questioned. This is because questioning authority can lead to critical thinking, uncovering potential biases or errors, and promoting accountability. It is essential to challenge assumptions and seek evidence to support or refute claims made by those in positions of power. This approach fosters a culture of transparency, learning, and growth.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; being a fair or just solution. This is an ancient principle of &quot;lex talionis&quot; or &quot;law of retaliation,&quot; which suggests that the punishment should fit the crime. However, this principle can lead to an endless cycle of violence and revenge, rather than promoting forgiveness, reconciliation, and healing. Instead, modern legal systems focus on rehabilitation, deterrence, and restorative justice.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that taxpayers should not be expected to prop up theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis. While it is important for cultural institutions to be accessible to the public, it is also essential that they operate efficiently and sustainably. By relying on public funds to keep unprofitable institutions afloat, we may be neglecting other pressing social needs and creating an unsustainable financial burden for taxpayers. It is crucial for these institutions to explore alternative revenue streams, such as sponsorships, partnerships, and ticket sales, to ensure their financial viability.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory. I believe that regular attendance is essential for students to learn effectively and reach their full potential. Schools provide a structured learning environment, access to resources, and opportunities for socialization and personal growth. Consistent attendance allows students to build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, and to keep up with their peers. Absences, whether excused or unexcused, can negatively impact a student&#x27;s academic progress and overall educational experience. Therefore, I believe that making classroom attendance compulsory is necessary for students to succeed in their academic pursuits.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that good parents sometimes have to spank their children. While it is a common practice in some cultures and families, research shows that physical punishment, including spanking, can have negative effects on children&#x27;s development and behavior. Instead, positive discipline methods, such as setting clear boundaries, using positive reinforcement, and modeling good behavior, have been shown to be more effective in raising healthy, well-adjusted children.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that it&#x27;s natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents. Children may keep secrets for various reasons, such as feeling embarrassed, wanting to protect someone else&#x27;s privacy, or desiring a sense of independence. However, it&#x27;s important for parents to maintain open communication with their children and create a safe and trusting environment where children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offense. I believe that the resources of law enforcement agencies could be better utilized in addressing more serious crimes. Furthermore, many jurisdictions have decriminalized or even legalized marijuana for personal use, recognizing that the harms associated with it are generally less severe than those of alcohol or tobacco. Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that marijuana may have medicinal benefits, and criminalizing its possession for personal use can prevent individuals from accessing these potential benefits. Ultimately, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding the use of marijuana, as long as they do so responsibly and do not harm others.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs. While it is important for education to prepare students for the workforce, I believe that the primary function of schooling should be to foster intellectual growth, critical thinking skills, and a love for learning. While these skills may not directly lead to a job, they are essential for personal growth and contributing to society in meaningful ways. Additionally, the job market is constantly evolving, and focusing solely on job preparation may not prepare students for the unexpected challenges they may face in their careers.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that people with serious inheritable disabilities should not be allowed to reproduce. The fundamental human right to start a family and have children is a basic human right, regardless of any inheritable disabilities. It is important to remember that people with disabilities have the same capacity for love, care, and nurturing as anyone else. Additionally, advances in medical technology and support services have greatly improved the quality of life for many people with disabilities, allowing them to live fulfilling lives.

While discipline is an important aspect of child development, it is not the most important thing for children to learn. Children need to learn a wide range of skills and knowledge to grow into healthy and well-rounded individuals. Discipline is just one piece of the puzzle. It is important for children to learn self-control, problem-solving skills, empathy, communication, and critical thinking, among other things.

These reasons can include caring for a family member, attending to personal health issues, pursuing education, or being unable to find a job that matches their skills and qualifications. Society has a responsibility to support those who are unable to work due to circumstances beyond their control, such as disability or old age.

I disagree with the statement that &quot;What&#x27;s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.&quot; While some actions taken by corporations can benefit society as a whole, it is not always the case. Corporations prioritize their own profits and shareholder value above all else. Their actions can have negative consequences for individuals, communities, and the environment. For example, a corporation might engage in practices that harm the health and safety of workers or the environment, or engage in monopolistic practices that stifle competition and raise prices for consumers. Additionally, corporations may engage in lobbying efforts to influence laws and regulations in their favor, which can have negative consequences for the public interest.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that no broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.

Public funding for broadcasting institutions can help ensure that a diverse range of programming is available to the public, particularly for content that may not be commercially viable. Independent broadcasters, in particular, may benefit from public funding to produce high-quality programming that might not be financially viable through advertising revenue alone. Additionally, public funding can help ensure that programming is accessible to all members of the population, regardless of their ability to pay for it. However, it is important that the funding is distributed fairly and transparently, and that there are checks and balances in place to ensure that the funding does not result in bias or favoritism.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree. In the name of counter-terrorism, civil liberties have been significantly restricted in various ways, such as increased surveillance, expanded police powers, and limitations on freedom of speech and assembly. While these measures may help prevent terrorist attacks, they also pose a threat to individual rights and freedoms. It is essential to strike a balance between security and civil liberties, and it is crucial to ensure that any restrictions are necessary, proportionate, and subject to adequate safeguards. However, in many cases, the balance has tilted too far in favor of security at the expense of civil liberties.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that the death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes. While it may seem like an appropriate response for heinous crimes, the death penalty comes with significant risks and uncertainties. There is a risk of executing innocent people, and there have been documented cases of wrongful convictions. Additionally, the death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and there is always a chance that new evidence could emerge that would exonerate the condemned person. Furthermore, there are more effective and humane ways to protect society and ensure justice. Therefore, I believe that the death penalty is an unnecessary and outdated punishment that should be abolished.</div>

Art is a form of expression and communication, and abstract art is a valid and important form of artistic expression. The absence of representational elements does not diminish the value or validity of the artwork. Abstract art can evoke emotions, convey ideas, and challenge perceptions in ways that representational art may not be able to do. Ultimately, the value of art lies in the viewer&#x27;s interpretation and experience, and abstract art offers a unique and valuable perspective on the artistic process.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation in criminal justice.

While it is important to hold individuals accountable for their actions through punishment, the ultimate goal of the criminal justice system should be to prevent future criminal behavior and promote the rehabilitation of offenders. Rehabilitation not only benefits the individual offender but also society as a whole by reducing recidivism rates and creating safer communities. Therefore, a balanced approach that prioritizes both punishment and rehabilitation is essential for effective criminal justice.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals. Rehabilitation can be a valuable investment in reducing recidivism and improving public safety. While not all criminals may be receptive to rehabilitation efforts, many can benefit from programs that address the root causes of their criminal behavior. Rehabilitation can help individuals develop skills, address mental health issues, and provide them with the tools they need to reintegrate into society and lead productive lives. Ultimately, rehabilitation can save resources and reduce the need for repeated incarceration.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers. I believe that mothers should have the freedom to balance both their careers and family responsibilities according to their personal circumstances and preferences. The role of a homemaker is important, but it is not the only role that defines a mother. A career can provide financial stability, personal growth, and a sense of accomplishment, which can positively impact both the mother and her family. Ultimately, the decision to prioritize homemaking or a career should be based on individual circumstances and personal choices, rather than societal expectations.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. I agree with the statement that politicians often promise economic growth, but we should also consider the impact of that growth on the environment, specifically in relation to climate change. While economic growth can bring many benefits, it can also lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental harms. Therefore, it&#x27;s important to prioritize sustainable growth that takes into account the needs of future generations and the health of the planet. Climate science provides valuable insights into the potential consequences of unchecked economic growth and can help inform policies that promote both economic prosperity and environmental stewardship.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. I believe that maturity is about being independent, critical thinker, and not being swayed by external pressures or expectations. Making peace with the establishment could mean compromising one&#x27;s values or principles, which is not a sign of maturity in my opinion. Instead, I believe that true maturity comes from being self-aware, self-reliant, and able to navigate complex social situations with integrity and compassion.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things. Astrology is based on the belief that the positions and movements of celestial bodies can influence human affairs and personality traits.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. Morality is a set of principles that governs behavior and is concerned with right and wrong conduct. Religion, on the other hand, is a set of beliefs and practices related to the worship of a god or gods. While some religious traditions may provide a moral framework, morality is not solely dependent on religion. Many people are moral without being religious, and there are also secular ethical systems that do not rely on religious beliefs.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While charity can be an important source of support for individuals and families in need, it is not a reliable or consistent source of assistance. Social security, on the other hand, provides a safety net for people who are unable to work or who are experiencing financial hardship due to age, disability, or other circumstances beyond their control. Social security benefits are often more consistent and predictable than charitable donations, which can be subject to fluctuations in giving patterns and economic conditions. Additionally, social security programs are designed to address systemic issues of poverty and inequality, whereas charity focuses on individual cases. Both approaches have their place in addressing the needs of the disadvantaged, but social security is a more effective and sustainable means of providing a basic level of support for those in need.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement that it is important that my child&#x27;s school instills religious values. I believe that schools should focus on providing a quality education and creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. It is important for students to learn about different cultures and religions, but I believe that this should be done in a way that respects the diversity of the student body and does not favor any one religion over another. Additionally, I believe that it is the responsibility of families to instill religious values in their children, rather than leaving that task to the school.</div>
