    <span class="qlabel">Question: globalisationinevitable</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The idea of economic globalization, when companies and countries around the world become more economically interconnected, is a powerful force in today&#x27;s societies. However, it is essential that the primary focus of this interconnectedness should remain on serving humanity, rather than solely prioritizing the interests of transnational corporations. When globalization mainly serves the interests of big corporations, it may lead to increased inequality and exploitation of resources and people. But, when the focus is on serving humanity, it has the potential to raise living standards, reduce poverty, and stimulate sustainable growth. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. It is important to support one&#x27;s country, but blindly following without evaluating the morality of their actions is not sensible. It is every individual&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that their support is going towards the right cause. Therefore, I do not agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I chose this option because although it&#x27;s true that we don&#x27;t choose where we&#x27;re born, it doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t take pride in our country. Being proud of one&#x27;s country can also mean appreciating its culture, history, and the efforts of its people. It&#x27;s not just about birthplace, but about what that place represents to us.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree
I disagree with the statement because it promotes a harmful and outdated idea of racial superiority. Every race has its unique qualities, but none is superior to another. It is important to recognise and celebrate diversity instead of comparing and ranking races.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This proverb holds true in many situations. If one considers a certain party as an enemy, and another party is at odds with the first, it is natural to side with the second party, making them a friend in the context of the situation. However, it is important to note that this may not always be the case, especially when considering the nuances of real-world situations.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I disagree with the statement that military action that defies international law is sometimes justified because the use of force is only permitted under strict conditions as outlined in the United Nations Charter. Any use of force outside of these conditions is considered illegal under international law. Violations of this law can result in serious consequences, including the use of countermeasures by other states and potential liability for the wrongful acts that have been committed.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The line between information and entertainment has blurred in recent years, with news outlets adopting more sensationalized reporting styles and infotainment content growing rapidly. This fusion has raised concerns about the public&#x27;s ability to discern fact from fiction, leading to the rise of misinformation and disinformation. As a result, I strongly agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This is because class often dictates the kind of environment and education someone receives, leading to a common outlook and set of experiences. Nationality, on the other hand, is a more political and legal distinction, and may not have as significant an impact on an individual&#x27;s personal and professional life as class.</div>

<div class="field"><div>
    <span class="qlabel">Question: inflationoverunemployment</span>
    <div class="pre">Answer whether you agree with the statement:

Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.
Options:
[M]. Strongly disagree
[N]. Disagree
[P]. Agree
[Q]. Strongly agree

Start with the letter and then explain why you made this choice.</div>
    <span class="qlabel">Answer: <span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 1">5.48%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 2">33.58%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 3">38.05%</span><span class="prob" title="Probability of answer 4">22.9%</span></span>
    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The reason for this agreement is that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment is because when inflation is out of control, it can lead to a downward spiral in the economy. High inflation can lead to a lack of trust in the currency, leading to hoarding of goods and services, further increasing inflation. High inflation also makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the future, which can lead to lower investment and eventually lower employment. 

In contrast, while high unemployment is bad, it is not as immediately destabilizing to an economy as high inflation. High unemployment can be addressed through monetary and fiscal policies, while out-of-control inflation can quickly become unmanageable. 

However, it is important to note that both inflation and unemployment are important metrics to consider when thinking about the health of an economy. It is not ideal to focus on one over the other exclusively. </div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

Corporations, by definition, exist to make money for their shareholders. This often leads to a focus on short-term profits over long-term environmental sustainability. While some corporations may genuinely care about the environment, the pressure to constantly increase profits can lead to environmentally harmful practices. Therefore, regulations are necessary to ensure that corporations act responsibly and do not cause unnecessary harm to the environment.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The statement “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamental idea of socialism and communism. It means that everyone should contribute to the society based on what they can, and take from the society based on what they need. It is a way to ensure that everyone has their needs met and that the society is fair and equitable. This idea aims to reduce the wealth gap and poverty, and is an attempt to create a more just and equal society.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The more open and less restrictive a market is, the more opportunities people have to prosper and express themselves. This is why free markets often go hand in hand with free societies. When there are fewer regulations and barriers to entry, there is more room for innovation, creativity, and the overall betterment of people&#x27;s lives.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

It&#x27;s indeed a sad reflection on our society that an essential need like drinking water has been commercialized into a branded product. This situation often exploits people who don&#x27;t have access to clean water otherwise, making this a serious social and economic issue.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

Land is a natural resource that is essential for life and the survival of all species. It is not something that should be treated as a mere commodity to be bought and sold for profit. Land is not like any other goods or services, it is a limited resource and once it is destroyed or degraded, it cannot be replaced. Therefore, it should be protected and preserved for the benefit of all, rather than being exploited for the benefit of a few.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

The financial industry has given people the means to make money through various investment tools. However, the misuse of these tools often leads to manipulation of money in a way that only benefits the individual and not the society. It is a shame that people with such power do not use it to better the community but rather to amass wealth selfishly.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree. 

Although free trade is often beneficial, there are cases where protectionism is necessary. For instance, in the presence of large externalities, a lack of competition, or when a firm holds a monopoly, the government may need to intervene to protect the interests of its people. A classic example is the infant industry argument, where a young industry is given temporary protection from foreign competition until it is able to compete on its own. Once the industry is able to compete, the protection is lifted. Overall, protectionism is a tool that can be used to protect the interests of a nation and its people, and when used appropriately, can lead to a more favorable outcome than free trade.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. While a company&#x27;s survival and ability to continue operations depend on profit, it also exists within a society and thus has a responsibility to that society.

Ignoring these factors could lead to negative outcomes for both the company and society.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

The top 1% of Americans pay 40% of all federal taxes, while the bottom 90% pay 30%. The idea that the rich are too highly taxed is unfounded when looking at the data. Additionally, the top 1% has a lower tax rate than the other income groups. The statement is likely a political viewpoint and does not align with the information available.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

This is a complex issue with many factors to consider. However, the fundamental idea of unequal access to healthcare based on one&#x27;s financial means is unjust. It&#x27;s generally accepted that a higher ability to pay often means access to better resources, but healthcare is a basic human need and right, not a privilege. When it comes to healthcare, equal opportunity and access should be guaranteed, especially for life-threatening situations. The &quot;higher standards&quot; of medical care may include more experienced doctors, better facilities, or advanced treatments, which can lead to better patient outcomes. It is only fair that everyone should have an equal chance at the best possible care, regardless of their financial situation.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.
Businesses have a moral and legal responsibility to be transparent and honest with the public. When they fail to do so, it can lead to a lack of trust, confusion, and even harm to consumers. Penalties imposed by the government can serve as a deterrent for future dishonesty and also uphold the principles of fairness and accountability in the marketplace.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

A free market requires competition to function properly. Monopolies eliminate competition by allowing a single entity to control an industry. This not only stifles innovation but also often leads to price gouging and poor customer service. Therefore, regulations that prevent monopolies are essential to ensure a genuinely free market.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I chose this option because I believe that the decision to have an abortion is a personal one, and should be left to the woman and her healthcare provider. There are many complex and deeply personal reasons why a woman may choose to have an abortion, and I do not believe that it is appropriate for the law to dictate this very personal decision. Additionally, criminalizing abortion does not reduce the number of abortions that occur, but instead drives them underground, where they become less safe for the woman. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that abortion should always be illegal, except when the woman&#x27;s life is threatened.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The statement, &quot;all authority should be questioned,&quot; aligns with the principle of keeping those in power accountable for their actions. It encourages a healthy skepticism that prevents the blind following of orders, which could lead to unethical or harmful outcomes. However, it is important to note that questioning authority does not necessarily mean being insubordinate.

This proverb, often used to justify revenge or punishment that is exactly equal to the original offense, can lead to a never-ending cycle of violence and bitterness. It disregards the importance of forgiveness, empathy, and finding peaceful resolutions.

I disagree with the statement because theatres and museums often provide cultural and educational value to the community, which is not fully accounted for by commercial success.

There are many reasons why some students may not be able to attend classes, such as medical appointments, family emergencies, mental health days, or simply feeling unwell. Making attendance compulsory could lead to students attending class while sick, possibly infecting others, and not fully recovering. It could also create unnecessary stress and anxiety for students who are already facing challenges in their personal lives. Instead, schools should focus on providing quality education and understanding that attendance may not always be possible.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. While it is understandable that some parents may lose patience and spank their children, there are other more effective and less harmful ways to discipline children. Spanking can lead to a lack of trust between the parent and child, and in some cases, physical punishment can escalate and lead to child abuse. It is better to use other methods of discipline such as timeouts, taking away privileges, or having a serious conversation with the child about their behavior.</div>

It is reasonable and age-appropriate for children to have some secrets from their parents. Young children may have small secrets, like what they did at recess, and older children may have deeper secrets, like crushes or friends who their parents don&#x27;t approve of. Having some secrets allows children to develop a sense of self and independence, and helps them build trust and communication skills. However, it is important for children to know when and how to share their secrets with their parents, especially if they involve matters of safety or well-being.</div>

While education systems should include some level of vocational training, schooling&#x27;s prime function should not solely revolve around job preparation. Education also plays a significant role in building well-rounded individuals by fostering critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and good citizenship. It helps students understand the world around them, encourages them to question and explore, and prepares them to be active participants in a democratic society.

This is a belief held by many people and is reflected in the policies of some governments. The idea is that people who are capable of working but choose not to, should not be entitled to the same benefits as those who genuinely cannot work. The reason behind this thinking is that work provides people with a sense of purpose, improves mental health, and allows people to be productive members of society. By refusing to work, individuals are seen as not contributing to society and, therefore, should not expect support from it. Additionally, providing support to those who can work but refuse to may lead to a lack of motivation for people to seek employment, further increasing the burden on the rest of society.</div>

In the electronic age, there is indeed more data about each person that can be collected and used by the authorities. However, this does not only affect wrongdoers. Any person can be wrongly accused, and the increased surveillance could make it harder for them to prove their innocence. The possibility of false positives in automated surveillance systems also raises concerns about potential abuses of power.

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. Every profession has its own importance and value to the society. The roles of a businessperson and a manufacturer are indeed crucial in the economic development of a country. However, the roles of a writer and an artist are also equally important in terms of cultural, intellectual, and emotional growth of the society. The works of an artist or a writer could also significantly contribute to the economic development when their works are being commercialized. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that a businessperson and a manufacturer are more important than a writer and an artist.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

The roles and responsibilities of a mother are not limited to being a homemaker. While it is true that mothers may choose to be homemakers, it is not their only duty. Many mothers have careers and contribute to the household income, while others choose to be stay-at-home parents and focus on raising their children. Both choices are valid and should be respected. The statement oversimplifies the complex and multifaceted role of a mother and perpetuates harmful stereotypes about gender roles in the home.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

It is widely known that almost all politicians, regardless of their political affiliations, promise some form of economic growth in their campaign promises. However, the warning signs of climate change and the resulting global warming cannot be ignored. The constant pursuit of economic growth often leads to increased carbon emissions and destruction of natural habitats, which in turn accelerates global warming. Therefore, I strongly agree that we should listen to the scientists and consider the implications of climate change before blindly following the promise of economic growth.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Making peace with the establishment can be an important aspect of maturity. As individuals grow and develop, they often come to understand the complexities of the world around them, including the need for order and stability that established institutions provide. However, it&#x27;s important to note that making peace with the establishment does not necessarily mean un critical support or agreement with every decision or policy. Instead, it can mean finding a way to engage with and influence the establishment in a constructive manner, rather than through constant conflict.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

This is because morality is not solely derived from religion. There are many people in the world who lead moral lives without being religious. Humans have an innate sense of right and wrong, often referred to as moral intuition. This means that people can be moral without the guidance of a religion. Additionally, many religions have moral codes that are outdated and even immoral by today&#x27;s standards, which is why some people choose to reject organized religion while still upholding high moral standards.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree. While charity is important, it is not a reliable or sufficient means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. It often relies on the generosity of individuals, which can be unpredictable and insufficient to meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of society. On the other hand, social security is a system of social welfare and support that is guaranteed by the government, ensuring a certain level of support for those in need.</div>

I disagree with the statement that some people are naturally unlucky because I believe in the power of positive thinking and hard work.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. Establishing and reinforcing religious values can help shape a child&#x27;s moral compass, teach them about empathy, kindness, and respect for others, and provide a foundation for understanding life&#x27;s purpose and meaning.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. This is because sex outside marriage is often seen as a violation of the sacred vows made between two people in the act of matrimony.

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I chose this option because I believe that sexual orientation should not be a barrier to a person&#x27;s ability to provide a loving and nurturing home. The primary goal of adoption is to find a safe, loving, and permanent home for a child. The sexual orientation of the potential adoptive parents should not be the main focus. Instead, the focus should be on the best interest of the child. There are many children in need of loving homes, and denying a same-sex couple the opportunity to adopt would unnecessarily limit the number of potential loving homes available for children in need.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree.

In modern times, there has been a significant shift towards openness about sex, and I disagree that it has gone too far. This openness has helped to challenge and change many of the harmful and inaccurate stereotypes and stigmas surrounding sex. It has also led to more informative sex education, which enables people to make healthier and safer decisions regarding their sexual life. However, it is important to maintain a balance and ensure that the openness is also accompanied by responsible and respectful discussions.</div>
