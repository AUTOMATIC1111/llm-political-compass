    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. The primary goal of economic globalisation should indeed prioritize the needs and welfare of humanity as a whole. While trans-national corporations can play a significant role in driving global growth, their interests should not supersede the essential needs of the global population. Balancing the interests of both parties is crucial, but ultimately, economic globalisation should aim to create a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive world.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. While I understand the importance of patriotism, unconditional support for one&#x27;s country, regardless of its actions, can lead to complacency about potential wrongdoings.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it is true that no one chooses their country of birth, it is not foolish to be proud of it. One&#x27;s country of birth often shapes their culture, values, and identity. It&#x27;s a matter of pride to belong to a community that has its unique history, traditions, and achievements. However, this pride should not lead to discrimination or superiority complex over other nations. It&#x27;s about appreciating and respecting one&#x27;s roots.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree

I strongly disagree with the statement because it promotes a harmful and inaccurate perspective of racial superiority. Each race and ethnicity has its unique qualities, strengths, and cultural values. It is essential to respect and appreciate these differences rather than ranking them as superior or inferior. This mindset fosters division and discrimination, which is against the principles of equality, fairness, and mutual respect.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

This statement, &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; is a common saying, but it is not always true in practice. In fact, it can lead to unhealthy alliances and potentially dangerous situations. It is essential to consider each situation individually and evaluate potential allies based on shared values and goals, rather than simply because they are at odds with someone else.</div>

    <div class="pre">M

I strongly disagree with the statement that military action defying international law is sometimes justified. International law is established to maintain peace, security, and order among nations. Disregarding these laws can lead to unpredictable consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and increased tensions between countries. It is essential to uphold and respect international law to preserve global stability and foster diplomatic resolutions to conflicts.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

The fusion of information and entertainment has been increasingly prevalent in today&#x27;s media landscape. This phenomenon, often referred to as infotainment, can be seen in various formats, such as news programs incorporating sensationalism and entertainment-style storytelling, and the rise of influencers who blur the lines between news, personal stories, and brand promotion. This fusion can sometimes compromise the integrity and credibility of information, making it difficult for consumers to distinguish fact from fiction. Consequently, it is essential to promote media literacy and critical thinking skills to help individuals navigate this evolving media landscape.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

While nationality plays a significant role in shaping one&#x27;s identity and experiences, social class often has a profound impact on people&#x27;s opportunities, perspectives, and life outcomes. This is not to diminish the importance of nationality, but rather to highlight the significant influence of class in people&#x27;s lives. Therefore, I choose &#x27;P&#x27; for &#x27;Partially agree&#x27;. However, it&#x27;s important to note that both factors can intersect and interact in complex ways, making the relationship between class and nationality a nuanced and context-dependent issue.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While controlling inflation is indeed crucial for a stable economy, it is not inherently more important than controlling unemployment. Both are essential components of a healthy economy. Inflation, when unchecked, can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, causing economic instability. On the other hand, high unemployment rates can lead to social issues, decreased consumer confidence, and a potential decrease in aggregate demand, which can also destabilize the economy. Therefore, both aspects should be carefully managed and balanced for the overall well-being of an economy.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

Corporations, by their very nature, prioritize profits for their shareholders. While many corporations do take steps to minimize their environmental impact, there are still numerous instances where they prioritize profits over environmental concerns. This is where regulation becomes crucial. It ensures that corporations adhere to certain standards that protect the environment, even when it may not be in their immediate financial interest to do so. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This principle, often associated with socialism and communism, emphasizes fairness and equal distribution of resources. It suggests that those who are more capable or have more resources should contribute more, while those with greater needs should receive more in return. This can lead to a more equitable society, where everyone&#x27;s basic needs are met, and excessive wealth is distributed to support others. However, it&#x27;s essential to have a well-functioning system to determine individuals&#x27; abilities and needs fairly, which can be challenging to implement in practice.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

The statement suggests a correlation between a free market and personal freedom. In many cases, a free market can lead to increased opportunities, innovation, and economic growth, which can contribute to personal freedom. However, it is essential to note that this relationship is not absolute. Other factors, such as government regulation, social structures, and individual rights, also significantly influence personal freedom. Therefore, while I agree with the statement to some extent, I also acknowledge that the relationship between a free market and personal freedom is complex and multifaceted.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

I strongly agree with this statement because it highlights a concerning trend in our society. Access to clean drinking water is a fundamental human right, yet it has become commercialized. This transformation can lead to disparities in access, with those who can afford it having easier access than others. Additionally, the mass production and disposal of plastic water bottles contribute significantly to environmental pollution.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. Land is a finite resource that is essential for life and should be preserved for future generations.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

While it is true that some individuals amass wealth through financial manipulation without contributing to societal growth, it is also important to acknowledge that not all wealth creation is detrimental. For instance, some people may accumulate wealth through innovation, entrepreneurship, or investment in industries that stimulate economic growth and job creation. However, if the focus is solely on those who manipulate money without contributing positively to society, then I agree with the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

Protectionism, or the policy of protecting domestic industries by imposing restrictions on imports, can be necessary in certain situations. For instance, it can be used to safeguard strategic industries, especially during the early stages of their development. It can also be a tool for governments to respond to unfair trade practices, such as dumping, where foreign companies sell their products at artificially low prices to drive domestic competitors out of business. However, it&#x27;s crucial to note that excessive protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, higher costs for consumers, and potential trade wars. Therefore, while I agree that protectionism can be necessary in some cases, it should be used judiciously and not as a general policy.</div>

    <div class="pre">N.
While profit is certainly an important aspect of a company&#x27;s responsibilities, it is not the only social responsibility a company has. Companies also have a duty to their employees, customers, the environment, and the communities in which they operate. This holistic approach to corporate social responsibility can lead to long-term profitability, as it helps to build a positive brand image, fosters trust with stakeholders, and contributes to a sustainable business environment. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that a company&#x27;s sole social responsibility is to deliver a profit to its shareholders.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

The statement is not supported by most data and research. According to the OECD, the top 10% of earners in the United States pay around 45% of all federal taxes, while the bottom 50% pay around 3%. This suggests that the rich are not overtaxed, but rather undertaxed in comparison to their income levels. Furthermore, many countries have lower tax rates for higher income brackets, which also contradicts the statement.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree. This is because the ability to pay often correlates with a person&#x27;s socioeconomic status, which can influence their access to better healthcare services. In a fair and equitable society, it is essential that everyone has equal opportunities to access high-quality medical care. However, in reality, resources are often limited, and those who can afford better care usually receive it. To promote social justice and fairness, it is crucial to strive for a healthcare system where everyone has equal access to high-standard medical care, regardless of their financial capabilities.</div>

Businesses have a moral and legal responsibility to provide accurate and truthful information to the public. Misleading the public can lead to uninformed decisions, mistrust, and market inefficiencies. Penalising such businesses can serve as a deterrent, encouraging them to maintain transparency and honesty in their practices. This, in turn, fosters a fair and well-informed market, which is beneficial for both consumers and businesses adhering to ethical standards.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The reason for my choice is that a free market is based on the principles of fair competition and consumer choice. Predatory multinationals, through their ability to create monopolies, can distort this balance by eliminating competition and dictating prices. This situation can lead to a decrease in consumer welfare and the overall efficiency of the market. Therefore, restrictions on monopolistic practices are essential to maintain the health and fairness of a free market system.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree. This is because the decision to have an abortion is deeply personal and complex, often involving factors such as the woman&#x27;s health, financial situation, and readiness to become a parent. Making abortion always illegal could lead to unsafe procedures and undue hardship for the woman. It&#x27;s essential to trust women to make decisions about their own bodies and lives. Additionally, outlawing abortion does not reduce the number of abortions; instead, it increases the risk of complications and maternal mortality. Access to safe and legal abortion is a matter of human rights and public health.</div>

While it is important to support arts and culture, it is not necessarily the responsibility of taxpayers to fund institutions that cannot sustain themselves commercially.

While I understand the argument for flexibility and autonomy, I believe that compulsory classroom attendance is important for several reasons. Firstly, it encourages discipline and punctuality, which are valuable skills in many aspects of life. Secondly, it facilitates social interaction and teamwork among students, contributing to their emotional and social development. Lastly, it ensures that students receive direct and immediate feedback on their learning progress, which can be crucial for their academic growth. However, I also believe that there should be exceptions for legitimate reasons, such as health issues or family emergencies.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While it is true that discipline is an important part of parenting, there are more effective and positive methods of discipline than spanking.

This choice is based on the understanding that children, like all individuals, have a right to privacy and personal growth. Keeping some secrets can be a part of this process, as it allows children to establish their own identity, test boundaries, and learn from their own experiences. It is a natural part of growing up and becoming independent. However, it is also important to note that this should not include secrets that could put the child in harm&#x27;s way or significantly jeopardize their well-being.</div>

I strongly agree with the statement because criminalizing personal marijuana use can lead to unnecessary incarceration, stigmatization, and other social issues.

Furthermore, legalization and regulation can help ensure product safety and generate tax revenue that can be directed towards public health and other societal benefits.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While preparing students for the workforce is certainly an important aspect of education, it is not the sole or even the primary purpose of schooling. Schools also play a crucial role in fostering critical thinking, creativity, social skills, emotional intelligence, and civic responsibility. These skills and values contribute not only to a person&#x27;s ability to secure and perform in a job, but also to their overall well-being and ability to contribute positively to society.

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree. It is not ethical to prevent individuals with inheritable disabilities from reproducing based solely on their genetic condition. Each person has the right to make their own reproductive choices, and it is essential to respect their autonomy. Additionally, genetic diversity is a natural part of human evolution, and disabilities do not necessarily equate to a lower quality of life.

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

While it is crucial for children to learn many things, accepting discipline is indeed one of the most important lessons. Discipline teaches children the importance of rules, structure, and order. It helps them understand the consequences of their actions and fosters self-control, respect for others, and responsibility. However, it&#x27;s equally important to balance discipline with understanding, patience, and positive reinforcement to ensure healthy psychological development.</div>

    <div class="pre">P. Agree

This choice is based on the principle of fairness and self-reliance. In an ideal society, individuals are expected to contribute to their own well-being and the welfare of the community. Therefore, those who can work but choose not to, are not demonstrating a sense of responsibility towards themselves or society. Hence, they should not expect societal support.

While completely avoiding thinking about a problem may not be the most effective strategy, engaging in more cheerful activities can help alleviate stress and anxiety.

The statement is somewhat absolute and does not account for the individual experiences and circumstances of first-generation immigrants. While it can be challenging for first-generation immigrants to fully integrate due to language barriers, cultural differences, and other factors, it is not impossible. Many first-generation immigrants do become fully integrated, contributing to and becoming an integral part of their new country. Integration is a process that can vary greatly from person to person, and it can take different forms and lengths of time. Therefore, I disagree with the statement.</div>

Public broadcasting institutions play a crucial role in maintaining a well-informed and diverse society. They often provide unbiased news, educational content, and promote cultural values.

    <div class="pre">P

While the concept of capital punishment may seem like a deterrent for serious crimes, I lean towards agreement due to the following considerations. In an ideal world, the criminal justice system would be perfect, with no room for error. However, in reality, there are instances where the system has failed, leading to wrongful convictions. The irreversible nature of the death penalty means that any mistake is final and cannot be rectified.

Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that the death penalty does not necessarily act as a stronger deterrent compared to life imprisonment without parole. The focus on rehabilitation and reintegration in the latter option can potentially contribute to a safer society.

That being said, I acknowledge that there are crimes of such heinous nature that some members of society may feel that the death penalty is a justifiable punishment. This is a complex and sensitive issue, with valid arguments on both sides. It is essential to continually evaluate</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree. While punishment can serve as a deterrent and hold offenders accountable for their actions, rehabilitation is crucial in preventing recidivism. By focusing on rehabilitation, we can address the root causes of criminal behavior, such as substance abuse, mental health issues, and socio-economic factors. This holistic approach not only benefits the individual but also contributes to safer communities in the long run.</div>

    <div class="pre">N. I disagree with the statement. While it is true that some criminals may be resistant to rehabilitation, it is not a waste of time to try. Every individual has the potential for change, and rehabilitation programs can provide resources, support, and opportunities for personal growth. Additionally, successful rehabilitation can lead to reduced rates of recidivism, benefiting both the individual and society. Therefore, it is important to continue offering rehabilitation programs and not dismiss them as a waste of time.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree.

While businesspeople and manufacturers play crucial roles in the economy, the impact of writers and artists on society is equally significant. Writers and artists contribute to the cultural, intellectual, and emotional well-being of society. They stimulate imagination, creativity, and critical thinking, which are essential for personal growth and societal progress. They also help preserve and evolve cultural heritage. Therefore, their roles are not less important than those of businesspeople and manufacturers.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. I believe that mothers, like all individuals, should have the freedom to choose their roles based on their personal values, skills, and aspirations. This includes having a career, being a homemaker, or combining both. The idea of a &#x27;first duty&#x27; can be restrictive and does not take into account the diversity of family structures and individual goals.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

The reason for my choice is that the statement accurately reflects the current political discourse, where economic growth is often prioritized over environmental concerns. However, scientific consensus indicates that unchecked economic growth, particularly one driven by high carbon emissions, contributes significantly to global warming. Therefore, it&#x27;s crucial to consider the warnings of climate science and seek a more sustainable and balanced approach to economic development.</div>

    <div class="pre">P

I chose &#x27;P&#x27; because making peace with the establishment can be seen as an important aspect of maturity. As individuals grow and develop, they often learn to navigate and interact effectively with societal structures and institutions. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean blindly agreeing with or endorsing the establishment, but rather finding a balanced and constructive approach to coexist and collaborate when needed. However, it is essential to maintain critical thinking and individuality, as well as to challenge and question the establishment when it&#x27;s appropriate.</div>

    <div class="pre">M

    <div class="pre">M

While there are many religious people who lead moral lives, it is not accurate to say that morality is exclusively tied to religious beliefs. Secular humanism, for example, promotes moral behavior without any religious context. Additionally, many religions have different interpretations of what is considered moral, which can lead to moral relativism within the same religious group. Therefore, morality and religious beliefs are not mutually inclusive or exclusive.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. I strongly disagree. While charity can provide essential support to the disadvantaged, it is not a reliable or consistent solution. Charity relies heavily on voluntary donations, which can be influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, public interest, and societal priorities. This inconsistency can lead to unpredictable support for the disadvantaged.

On the other hand, social security is a system where a portion of individuals&#x27; earnings are set aside to support those in need. This system ensures a more consistent and predictable safety net for the genuinely disadvantaged. It is not subject to the same fluctuations as charitable giving. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the idea that charity is a better means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged compared to social security.</div>

I disagree with the statement &quot;Some people are naturally unlucky.&quot; I believe that luck is a concept that is influenced by various factors, many of which are within our control or influenced by our actions and attitudes. While some people may seem to experience more negative events, this does not necessarily mean they are &quot;naturally unlucky.&quot; It could be a result of their perspective, resilience, or the way they handle situations.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

While I understand the importance of instilling moral and ethical values in children, I believe that this can be achieved through various means and not necessarily through religious teachings. Public schools, for instance, often promote values such as respect, responsibility, fairness, and integrity, which are universally accepted and not tied to a specific religion. This approach allows for a more inclusive environment that respects the diverse beliefs and backgrounds of all students.</div>

While I understand that many cultures and religions hold this view, I also recognize that there are many different perspectives on this matter.

Therefore, I disagree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

In my understanding, the primary goal of adoption is to provide a loving, stable, and nurturing environment for a child in need. The gender or sexual orientation of the potential parents should not be a determining factor in this process. Instead, the focus should be on the couple&#x27;s ability to provide a supportive and caring home. Therefore, I strongly agree that a same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship should not be excluded from the possibility of child adoption.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree.

I strongly agree with the statement for several reasons. Firstly, consenting adults should have the right to make their own decisions about their actions, as long as they do not harm others. Pornography, when produced and consumed responsibly, can be a form of self-expression and a source of sexual education. Secondly, criminalizing pornography can lead to censorship, which can infringe upon freedom of speech. Lastly, making pornography illegal would not eliminate its production or consumption, but rather drive it underground, where it would be more difficult to regulate and ensure the safety and consent of all parties involved.</div>

    <div class="pre">Q. Strongly agree

This statement aligns with the principles of personal autonomy, privacy, and individual liberty. Adults who engage in consensual activities in private spaces are exercising their right to personal freedom, which should not be subject to state intervention as long as no one is harmed. This perspective is grounded in respecting the boundaries of personal lives and upholding the fundamental human rights of privacy and autonomy.</div>

    <div class="pre">M. Strongly disagree. Sexual orientation, including homosexuality, is a natural and inherent aspect of a person&#x27;s identity.

    <div class="pre">N. Disagree

I choose this option because I believe that the level of openness about sex in today&#x27;s society varies greatly depending on the context and the individuals involved. While it&#x27;s true that there are instances where explicitness might be considered excessive, it&#x27;s also important to acknowledge the progress made in terms of sex education and the breaking of taboos, which has led to a healthier and more informed society. However, it&#x27;s essential to maintain a balance and ensure that discussions and representations of sex are respectful, age-appropriate, and informative rather than gratuitous.</div>
