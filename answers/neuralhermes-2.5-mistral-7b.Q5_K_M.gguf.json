            "answer": "Q. I agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Economic globalisation, which refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies through trade, investment, and movement of capital, labor, and transfer of technology and knowledge across borders, can indeed bring about numerous benefits such as increased efficiency, innovation, and improved living standards. However, it is crucial that it benefits all stakeholders, particularly the people and nations involved, rather than just a select few corporations. By prioritizing humanity, we can ensure fair distribution of wealth, reduce inequalities, and promote sustainable development.",
