            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement. Economic globalisation is a complex phenomenon that has both positive and negative impacts on societies and the environment. While it has led to increased trade, investment, and technological advancements, it has also contributed to income inequality, exploitation of labour, and environmental degradation. It is crucial that economic globalisation serves the interests of all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and the planet, rather than just trans-national corporations. Governments and international organisations should work together to create a more equitable and sustainable global economic system that benefits everyone.",

In today's digital age, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between news and entertainment content. Social media platforms, news websites, and even traditional media outlets often prioritize clickbait headlines and sensationalist stories over factual reporting. This blurring of lines can lead to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, as well as a general decline in media literacy among the public. Additionally, the pressure to monetize content through advertising and other revenue streams can incentivize content creators to prioritize entertainment value over informative content.

This is because class is a socio-economic construct that determines a person's access to resources, opportunities, and power. It shapes their worldview, values, and lifestyle. On the other hand, nationality is primarily a legal and political construct that defines a person's citizenship and affiliation with a particular country. While nationality can influence cultural identity and historical experiences, it does not necessarily determine a person's social status or economic circumstances. Therefore, class divisions often cut across national boundaries and create deeper fissures within societies than nationality alone.",

            "answer": "P. I agree that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and if left unchecked, it can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, making it harder for people to afford basic necessities. On the other hand, unemployment refers to the percentage of the labor force that is currently without work but actively seeking employment. While high unemployment rates are undesirable, they can be addressed through various policies such as job creation programs and fiscal stimulus packages. However, controlling inflation requires a different approach, such as implementing monetary policies like raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, which can have negative effects on economic growth and employment in the short term.

Additionally, during periods of economic crisis or structural change, governments may choose to protect certain industries to maintain employment and prevent social unrest. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, as it can lead to inefficiencies, higher prices for consumers, and potential retaliation from trading partners.",

The primary responsibility of a company is to generate profits for its shareholders, as they are the ones who have invested their money in the company. Profits are essential for the company's survival, growth, and expansion. Without profits, the company cannot reinvest in itself, pay dividends to shareholders, or create new job opportunities. Therefore, maximizing profits should be the primary goal of a company, subject to legal and ethical considerations. However, this does not mean that companies should not engage in socially responsible practices; rather, they should do so in a manner that aligns with their business objectives and does not harm their profitability.",

I agree that the rich are too highly taxed.\n\nWhile it is important to have a progressive tax system where those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their earnings in taxes, the current tax rates in many countries are excessive. The top marginal tax rate in the United States, for example, can be as high as 37% at the federal level, and many states have their own additional taxes. This means that individuals who earn high incomes can end up paying a significant portion of their earnings in taxes, which can discourage work, investment, and entrepreneurship. Additionally, high tax rates can lead to tax avoidance and evasion, which reduces government revenue and increases the burden on lower-income taxpayers. Therefore, while it is necessary to tax the rich, it is also important to ensure that tax rates are reasonable and do not unduly burden high-",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement \"Making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity.\" This is because as we grow older and gain more life experiences, we learn that it is often necessary to compromise and work within the system in order to achieve our goals. The establishment, whether it be government, corporate, or social, often holds significant power and influence over our lives, and learning how to navigate these systems effectively can lead to greater success and stability. While it's important to stand up for what we believe in and challenge injustices, there comes a time when we must also recognize the limitations of our power and find ways to coexist with the establishment in a productive manner. Therefore, making peace with the establishment can be a key aspect of personal growth and maturity.",

While it may not be a scientifically proven method, many people find solace and guidance in its predictions and interpretations. Astrology has been practiced for thousands of years and has evolved into a rich tradition with many followers worldwide.

            "answer": "P.

These guidelines often include concepts such as right and wrong, love for others, and respect for authority. For many people, their religious beliefs are the foundation of their moral compass, providing them with a framework for making ethical choices.

This is because charity often provides more personalized and immediate assistance to those in need, while social security systems can be bureaucratic and slow to respond. Additionally, charities can often target specific groups or individuals who may fall through the cracks of larger social security systems. However, it's important to note that both charity and social security have their place in addressing poverty and inequality, and a comprehensive approach that combines both can be most effective.",

There are instances where individuals may face a disproportionate number of challenges or setbacks despite their best efforts, suggesting that they may be inherently less fortunate. However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean that these individuals are doomed to a life of misfortune; they can still make choices and take actions to improve their circumstances.",

Additionally, religious values often promote positive behaviors such as kindness, respect, and responsibility, which are essential for personal growth and social harmony. However, it is important to note that the school should respect the religious diversity of its students and their families, and should not force any particular belief system upon them.",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral. This is because marriage is a sacred institution that is meant to unite two people in a lifelong commitment of love, trust, and respect. When two people get married, they make a promise to each other and to God to remain faithful and exclusive in their sexual relationship. Having sex outside of this commitment goes against the very purpose of marriage and can lead to hurt, betrayal, and brokenness. Additionally, engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage can have serious consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional turmoil. Therefore, it is generally considered immoral to engage in sexual activity outside of the bounds of marriage.",

This is because it is a form of expression and entertainment that individuals choose to engage in. As long as the content is consensual and not promoting any illegal or harmful activities, it should be protected under freedom of speech and expression. Additionally, legalizing pornography can help regulate the industry, ensuring that performers are protected and that the content is produced ethically. It also allows for better monitoring and enforcement of age restrictions, preventing minors from accessing inappropriate material.
