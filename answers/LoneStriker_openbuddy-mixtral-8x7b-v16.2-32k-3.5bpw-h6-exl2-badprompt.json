            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. The primary goal of economic globalisation should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, rather than solely benefiting a select few.\n\nEconomic globalisation has the potential to bring about numerous benefits, such as increased trade, technological advancements, and cultural exchange. However, these benefits should not come at the expense of the well-being of the majority of the world's population. It is crucial that the process of globalisation is guided by principles of fairness, equity, and sustainability, ensuring that the fruits of economic growth are shared equitably among all nations and peoples.\n\nTrans-national corporations play a significant role in driving economic globalisation, but their interests should not be prioritised over the broader interests of humanity. It is essential to establish a balance between the",

            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nThe statement \"There is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment\" is a concern that has been raised by many experts and scholars.

This fusion can have serious consequences, such as the spread of misinformation, the erosion of critical thinking skills, and the undermining of democratic institutions.\n\nThe rise of social media platforms, reality TV shows, and other forms of entertainment that incorporate news and current events has contributed to this worrying trend. These platforms often prioritize sensationalism, clickbait, and emotional manipulation over factual accuracy and critical analysis. As a result, audiences are increasingly exposed to a distorted view of the world, which can lead to confusion, polarization, and the erosion of trust in institutions and authorities.\n\nMoreover, the fusion of information and entertainment",

Additionally, protectionism can be used as a tool to protect national security interests, such as ensuring that a country has a reliable supply of essential goods and services.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while protectionism can be necessary in some cases, it can also have negative consequences, such as leading to trade wars and harming consumers by raising prices.

This means that the actual tax burden on the wealthy is often much lower than it appears on paper.\n\nSecondly, the rich have a much greater ability to pay taxes than the average person. They have more disposable income and can afford to pay more in taxes without significantly impacting their quality of life.\n\nThirdly, the tax system in many countries is designed to be progressive, meaning that those with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This is intended to ensure that the tax burden is distributed more fairly among different income levels.\n\nFinally, the rich often benefit from various government programs and services that are funded by taxes.

Therefore, it is reasonable to expect these institutions to operate on a commercial basis, generating enough revenue to cover their operational costs.\n\nSecondly, relying on taxpayer funding to support theaters and museums can lead to inefficiencies and misallocation of resources.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that the most important thing for children to learn is to accept discipline. While discipline is important for children to develop self-control and respect for authority, it is not the most important thing for them to learn.\n\nChildren should also learn essential life skills such as problem-solving, empathy, and critical thinking. These skills are crucial for their personal growth, academic success, and future relationships. By focusing solely on discipline, we may inadvertently neglect the development of these vital skills.\n\nMoreover, an overemphasis on discipline can lead to a rigid and authoritarian approach to parenting, which may stifle a child's creativity and curiosity. It is essential to strike a balance between discipline and nurturing a child's natural curiosity and desire to explore the world around them.\n\nIn conclusion, while discipline is an important aspect of a child's upbringing, it",

By recognizing that all cultures have their own unique characteristics, we can foster a more inclusive and tolerant global community.\n\nMoreover, the notion of \"savage\" and \"civilised\" is a product of colonial and imperialistic ideologies that sought to justify the domination and exploitation of non-Western societies. These terms are rooted in Eurocentric and ethnocentric biases that have been used to dehumanize and marginalize non-Western cultures.\n\nBy rejecting the idea",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that no broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.

Without public funding, broadcasting institutions may be forced to rely solely on advertising revenue, which can lead to a homogenization of content as institutions cater to the interests of their advertisers. Public funding allows for the creation of content that may not be profitable but is still valuable to society, such as educational programming, documentaries, and news coverage.\n\nSecondly, public funding helps to maintain the independence of broadcasting institutions. When institutions are solely reliant on advertising revenue, they may be more susceptible to external pressures, such as the influence of advertisers or political interests.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers. In today's society, women have the right to pursue their careers and personal goals just like men do. It is important to recognize that being a homemaker is a choice, not an obligation. Mothers can be both successful in their careers and excellent homemakers, as long as they find a balance that works for them and their families.\n",

            "answer": "P.

This can be beneficial in various aspects of life, such as in the workplace, in personal relationships, and in political and social contexts. By finding ways to coexist and collaborate with established structures, individuals can often achieve their goals more effectively and with less conflict.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that making peace with the establishment does not necessarily mean compromising one's values or beliefs. It is possible to maintain one's principles while still finding ways to work within the existing framework. This balance between acceptance and resistance can be a challenging but ultimately rewarding aspect of personal growth and development.\n",

Many scientists and skeptics argue that astrology is not a reliable method for understanding the world around us. Instead, they advocate for the use of evidence-based approaches, such as psychology, sociology, and other social sciences, to gain a better understanding of human behavior and events.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things.

Social security is a more reliable and consistent means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged, as it is funded by the government and is designed to provide a basic level of support to those in need.\n\nTherefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.
