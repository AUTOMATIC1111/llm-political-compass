            "answer": "P\n\nI agree with the statement because I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\n\nEconomic globalisation is a process of increasing economic interdependence and integration between countries, driven by factors such as trade, investment, and technology. While it has brought many benefits, such as increased trade and investment, it has also led to increased inequality and exploitation of workers in developing countries.\n\nTrans-national corporations, or TNCs, are large multinational companies that operate across multiple countries. They have been a major driver of economic globalisation, but they have also been accused of exploiting workers and the environment in developing countries. For example, TNCs have been accused of using cheap labour in developing countries to produce goods at a lower cost, which can lead to lower wages and poor working conditions for workers.\n\nIn contrast, economic globalisation should primarily serve",

            "answer": "P\n\nProtectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.\n\nProtectionism is the practice of protecting domestic industry against foreign competition by means of tariffs, subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions.\n\nProtectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it can help to protect domestic industries from unfair competition from foreign companies. For example, if a foreign company is dumping products in the domestic market at a price that is below the cost of production, this can put domestic companies at a disadvantage and lead to job losses. In such cases, protectionist measures can be used to level the playing field and prevent the domestic industry from being harmed.\n\nHowever, protectionism can also have negative consequences. For example, it can lead to higher prices for consumers, as well as reduced competition and innovation. It can also lead to trade disputes and retaliatory measures, which can harm both the domestic and foreign economies",
