            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement because it emphasizes the ethical and humanitarian aspect of economic globalization. The statement implies that if globalization is indeed inevitable, it should prioritize the well-being of humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations. This perspective aligns with the idea that economic globalization should be a force for good, promoting social justice, equality, and sustainable development. It should not merely serve the interests of corporations, which often prioritize profit over the well-being of people and the planet.",

While there is a correlation between economic freedom and certain aspects of personal freedom, it's not a direct causal relationship. Economic freedom can contribute to personal freedom, but it's not the only factor. Other factors, such as political freedom, social freedom, and civil liberties, also play significant roles in determining the overall freedom of a society. Therefore, I disagree with the statement as it is overly simplistic and does not fully capture the complexity of the relationship between economic freedom and personal freedom.",

Everyone should have access to quality healthcare, regardless of their financial status.",

            "answer": "N (Disagree)\n\nI would choose to disagree with the statement that \"Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.\" While charity is a noble and essential part of society, it is not always the most effective or reliable method for helping the disadvantaged. \n\nCharity often relies on the goodwill and generosity of individuals, which can be inconsistent and unpredictable. Social security, on the other hand, is a system that provides a more stable and reliable safety net for those in need. It is a more structured and organized approach that can provide a more consistent level of support. While both are important, I would argue that social security is a more reliable and consistent means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",

            "answer": "N (Disagree)\n\nI disagree with the statement \"Some people are naturally unlucky\" because it implies a deterministic view of life where certain individuals are predestined to experience more hardships or misfortunes than others. This perspective can lead to a defeatist attitude and overlooks the role of personal agency, resilience, and the influence of one's actions and decisions in shaping one's life experiences. While it's true that some people may face more challenges than others, it doesn't mean they are inherently unlucky. Instead, it's more productive to focus on personal growth, resilience, and the ability to learn from and overcome adversity.",
