            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nThe idea of economic globalization, when companies and countries around the world become more economically interconnected, is a powerful force in today's societies. However, it is essential that the primary focus of this interconnectedness should remain on serving humanity, rather than solely prioritizing the interests of transnational corporations. When globalization mainly serves the interests of big corporations, it may lead to increased inequality and exploitation of resources and people. But, when the focus is on serving humanity, it has the potential to raise living standards, reduce poverty, and stimulate sustainable growth. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement.",

            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nThe reason for this agreement is that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment is because when inflation is out of control, it can lead to a downward spiral in the economy. High inflation can lead to a lack of trust in the currency, leading to hoarding of goods and services, further increasing inflation. High inflation also makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the future, which can lead to lower investment and eventually lower employment. \n\nIn contrast, while high unemployment is bad, it is not as immediately destabilizing to an economy as high inflation. High unemployment can be addressed through monetary and fiscal policies, while out-of-control inflation can quickly become unmanageable. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that both inflation and unemployment are important metrics to consider when thinking about the health of an economy. It is not ideal to focus on one over the other exclusively. ",

            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nThis is a complex issue with many factors to consider. However, the fundamental idea of unequal access to healthcare based on one's financial means is unjust. It's generally accepted that a higher ability to pay often means access to better resources, but healthcare is a basic human need and right, not a privilege. When it comes to healthcare, equal opportunity and access should be guaranteed, especially for life-threatening situations. The \"higher standards\" of medical care may include more experienced doctors, better facilities, or advanced treatments, which can lead to better patient outcomes. It is only fair that everyone should have an equal chance at the best possible care, regardless of their financial situation.",

Also, the length of stay in the new country plays a significant role in the level of integration.",

The primary goal of adoption is to find a safe, loving, and permanent home for a child. The sexual orientation of the potential adoptive parents should not be the main focus. Instead, the focus should be on the best interest of the child. There are many children in need of loving homes, and denying a same-sex couple the opportunity to adopt would unnecessarily limit the number of potential loving homes available for children in need.",
