            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree. I believe that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity, as it is a tool that can be used to improve the lives of people all over the world. Trans-national corporations have a role to play in this process, but their interests should not be the primary focus. Instead, the goal should be to create a global economic system that is fair, equitable, and sustainable for all people, regardless of where they live or what their economic status may be. This requires a strong commitment to ethical business practices, responsible corporate citizenship, and a willingness to work collaboratively with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to address the challenges and opportunities of globalization. Ultimately, the success of economic globalization will be measured not by the profits of corporations, but by the well-being of the people it is intended to serve.",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement.\n\nI agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. This is because in today's world, the line between news and entertainment has become increasingly blurred. With the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, there is a constant demand for new and exciting content. This has led to a situation where news outlets are often prioritizing sensationalism and entertainment value over accuracy and objectivity.\n\nFurthermore, the use of clickbait headlines and misleading information has become common practice, making it difficult for people to distinguish between fact and fiction. This not only undermines the credibility of news organizations, but it also has the potential to mislead and manipulate the public.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the fusion of information and entertainment is a worrying trend that needs to be addressed.

While it is true that a company's primary goal is to generate profits, it is also important for companies to consider their impact on society and the environment. Companies have a responsibility to their employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. This includes ensuring fair labor practices, providing safe and healthy workplaces, and minimizing their environmental footprint. By taking these social responsibilities into account, companies can build stronger relationships with their stakeholders, improve their reputation, and ultimately, contribute to a more sustainable and equitable society.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree. I do not agree that the rich are too highly taxed. The tax code in the United States is designed to be progressive, meaning that those who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. However, there are still many ways in which the wealthy can take advantage of tax loopholes and deductions to lower their overall tax burden. Additionally, the argument that the rich are overtaxed often ignores the fact that they also benefit from a wide range of public goods and services, such as infrastructure, education, and public safety, that are funded by taxes. Therefore, I believe that the current tax system is fair and that the rich are not overtaxed.",

This, in turn, can help ensure that they receive the best possible care, which can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that access to medical care should not be solely based on one's ability to pay. Everyone, regardless of their financial situation, should have access to basic medical care, and there should be measures in place to ensure that those who cannot afford to pay for higher standards of medical care are not left behind. This can include things like government-funded healthcare programs, subsidies, and other forms of financial assistance.",

Predatory multinationals, which are large corporations that use their market power to dominate and control a particular market, can create monopolies and stifle competition. This can lead to higher prices, less choice, and a lack of innovation.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to have some restrictions on the ability of these multinationals to create monopolies in order to maintain a genuine free market.

The idea that some cultures are superior to others is deeply ingrained in our society, but it is not based on any objective reality. Every culture has its own unique customs, traditions, and values, and they are all equally valid. By recognizing and respecting the diversity of human cultures, we can build a more inclusive and equitable world.",

This is because work is a fundamental aspect of life, and it is through work that individuals can contribute to society, support themselves, and achieve their goals. By refusing to work, a person is not only depriving themselves of the benefits of employment, but they are also not fulfilling their responsibilities as a member of society. However, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this, such as individuals who are unable to work due to illness or disability, or those who are in between jobs due to no fault of their own. In these cases, society should provide support to help individuals get back on their feet.",

Without public funding, these institutions may not be able to maintain their independence and impartiality, as they may have to rely on private funding, which could compromise their editorial independence.

In a democratic system, there are multiple parties that represent different interests and perspectives, and this diversity of opinions leads to a healthy debate and discussion. This debate is essential for progress, as it allows for the exploration of different ideas and the development of new solutions to problems. In a one-party state, there is no such debate, and as a result, progress is often hindered. Additionally, the lack of political competition in a one-party state can lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals, which can result in corruption and abuse of power.

            "answer": "N. Disagree. I do not believe that making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity. Maturity is a complex concept that involves personal growth, self-awareness, and the ability to make responsible decisions. While it is important to understand and navigate societal structures, making peace with them is not necessarily a sign of maturity. Instead, maturity can involve questioning, challenging, and working to change aspects of the establishment that are unjust or harmful.",

People can be moral because they have a sense of empathy, compassion, and fairness, and not necessarily because they follow a religious doctrine. Additionally, there are many instances of immoral behavior committed by religious people, which suggests that religious belief is not a guarantee of morality.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree. While charity can be a valuable source of support for the disadvantaged, it is not a reliable or consistent means of assistance. Social security, on the other hand, is a government-run program that provides a safety net for those in need, ensuring that they receive regular and predictable financial support. Charity, while well-intentioned, can be unpredictable and may not always be available when it is needed most. Additionally, social security is designed to be a long-term solution, while charity is often more of a short-term fix. For these reasons, I do not believe that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",

However, if two people have sex without mutual consent or respect for each other's boundaries, then this would be considered immoral. Ultimately, the morality of sex should be determined by the individuals involved and their personal beliefs, rather than being dictated by societal norms or religious doctrines.",
