            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. This is because the primary purpose of economic globalisation should be to improve the well-being and quality of life for all people, not just a select few. Trans-national corporations, while they can contribute to economic growth and development, often prioritize their own interests over the needs of the global population. By focusing on the needs of humanity, we can ensure that economic globalisation benefits everyone, not just a select few.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\" because it is a simplistic and potentially dangerous approach to forming alliances. While it may be true that two parties may temporarily align against a common enemy, it does not guarantee that they will share the same values, goals, or long-term interests.\n\nIn reality, alliances should be based on mutual trust, respect, and shared values. By focusing solely on the common enemy, one may overlook potential conflicts or disagreements that could arise once the immediate threat is eliminated.

            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI chose to strongly agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class divisions are often more deeply ingrained in society and can have a significant impact on people's lives, opportunities, and experiences.

Class divisions, on the other hand, are often rooted in economic and social structures that can be difficult to overcome and can perpetuate inequality and injustice.",

While it is true that some corporations may voluntarily take steps to protect the environment, the reality is that many do not.

This can be achieved through a combination of financial incentives, penalties for non-compliance, and the establishment of clear guidelines and standards for environmental protection.\n\nIn addition, regulation can help level the playing field for businesses, ensuring that those who prioritize sustainability are not at a competitive disadvantage to those who do not. Ultimately, regulation is a crucial tool in the fight against climate change and environmental degradation, and it is essential that governments and regulatory bodies continue to develop and enforce effective environmental policies.",

This can be particularly important for developing countries that are still building their economies and may not be able to compete with more established nations.\n\nProtectionism can also be used as a temporary measure to shield industries from sudden shocks or economic downturns, allowing them to recover and become more competitive in the long run. Additionally, it can be a tool for promoting national security by ensuring that essential goods and services are produced domestically.\n\nHowever, it is essential to strike a balance between protectionism and free trade, as excessive protectionism can lead to trade wars, reduced efficiency, and higher prices for consumers. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the specific circumstances and potential consequences before implementing protectionist policies.",

This perspective acknowledges the inherent value and complexity of diverse human societies, and it promotes a more nuanced understanding of cultural differences.\n\nThe concept of \"savage\" and \"civilised\" is often used to create a false dichotomy between cultures, with the implication that one is inherently superior to the other. However, this binary view fails to account for the unique values, beliefs, and practices that define each culture. By recognizing that there are only different cultures, we can appreciate the richness and variety of human experience, and work towards greater understanding and cooperation among diverse societies.",

While economic growth is essential for improving living standards and reducing poverty, it should not come at the cost of our planet's health.\n\nClimate science has provided ample evidence that unchecked economic growth, particularly in industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributes significantly to global warming. This warming, in turn, leads to a myriad of negative consequences, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and the extinction of various species.\n\nTo address these issues, it is crucial for politicians and policymakers to consider the long-term environmental impact of their decisions and work towards a more sustainable and equitable economic model. This may involve investing in renewable energy, promoting energy efficiency, and supporting sustainable industries.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is essential for human progress, it must be pursued in a way that does not exacerbate the already",

However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.\n\nAstrology relies on a belief in a supernatural connection between celestial bodies and human affairs, which is not supported by empirical evidence. The positions of the stars and planets have no direct influence on human behavior or events on Earth.\n\nFurthermore, astrology often contradicts itself, as different astrologers may provide conflicting predictions based on the same set of celestial positions. This inconsistency further undermines the credibility of astrology as a reliable method for predicting or explaining events.\n\nIn conclusion, astrology is not a valid method for accurately explaining or predicting events, and I strongly disagree with the statement that it does so.",

Morality is a complex concept that can be derived from various sources, including personal values, societal norms, and philosophical frameworks. While religion can provide a moral framework for some individuals, it is not the only source of morality.\n\nIn fact, many people who are not religious still adhere to strong moral principles and values. These principles can be based on empathy, compassion, and a desire to create a better world for all. Additionally, secular moral systems, such as utilitarianism and deontology, can provide a framework for moral decision-making that is not tied to any specific religious belief.\n\nIn conclusion, morality is not inherently tied to religion, and it is possible for individuals to be moral without adhering to any religious beliefs.",

Instead, it is influenced by a combination of factors such as personal choices, circumstances, and external factors.\n\nWhile it is true that some people may experience a series of unfortunate events, it does not necessarily mean that they are inherently unlucky. It is more likely that they are facing challenges or obstacles that are beyond their control. Additionally, the perception of luck can be subjective and influenced by personal beliefs and expectations.\n\nIn my opinion, it is more constructive to focus on understanding and addressing the underlying causes of perceived unluckiness rather than attributing it to a person's inherent nature.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement that sex outside marriage is usually immoral. While it is true that many cultures and religions hold the belief that sex should only occur within the context of marriage, it is not universally accepted as a moral absolute.\n\nThe concept of morality is subjective and varies greatly across different societies and individuals. Some may view sex outside marriage as a natural expression of human desire and intimacy, while others may consider it a violation of societal norms or religious teachings.\n\nMoreover, the idea of marriage itself has evolved over time and varies across cultures. In some societies, marriage is a legal contract, while in others, it is a spiritual or religious union. This variation in the definition and purpose of marriage further complicates the notion of what constitutes moral behavior in regards to sexual activity.\n\nIn conclusion, while sex outside marriage may be considered immoral by some, it is not universally accepted as such.
