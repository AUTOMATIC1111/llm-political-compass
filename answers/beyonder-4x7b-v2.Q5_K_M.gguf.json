            "answer": "Q. I strongly agree with this statement because economic globalisation, while it has its benefits, should ultimately aim to improve the lives of people worldwide rather than solely focusing on the profits of large corporations. Globalisation can bring about increased trade, investment, and technological advancements, but it should be managed in a way that ensures fairness, equality, and sustainability. By prioritising humanity, we can prevent exploitation, poverty, and environmental degradation. It's crucial to create policies and regulations that protect the rights and welfare of individuals and communities, not just the interests of big businesses.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_end|>",

            "answer": "P.

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality because, in many cases, social and economic factors play a significant role in shaping individuals' lives and experiences. While nationality can create a sense of identity and unity, it is often the disparities within a nation based on income, education, and access to resources that lead to greater divisions among people. Class differences can lead to different opportunities, access to services, and treatment within a society, which can be more impactful than the unifying factor of nationality.\n\nIncome inequality, for instance, can result in unequal access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, causing a rift between the rich and poor within a country. This can lead to social and political divisions that may be more prominent than the national identity. Additionally, people from different classes may have contrasting views on policies and priorities, which can create divisions within a nation. Although nationality can bring people together,",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment because, while both are essential for a healthy economy, high and persistent inflation can lead to a decline in purchasing power and erode the value of money, causing long-term damage to the economy. Inflation can also lead to higher interest rates, reducing investment and consumption, which can result in higher unemployment. By keeping inflation in check, governments can maintain stability and encourage economic growth. However, if unemployment is too low, it can lead to wage pressures and potential overheating of the economy, which can also have negative consequences. Balancing both is crucial, but in the long run, controlling inflation is more critical to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nInflation can have a more widespread and long-lasting impact on the economy compared to unemployment, as it affects everyone's purchasing power and can lead to social unrest.

            "answer": "P. I agree that a genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies because unchecked monopolies can lead to anti-competitive practices, stifle innovation, and harm consumers. While a free market ideally promotes competition and consumer choice, predator multinationals can use their size and resources to manipulate markets, stifle smaller competitors, and exploit their power to raise prices and reduce quality. Restrictions are necessary to maintain a level playing field and protect smaller businesses and consumers' interests.\n\nIn a truly free market, competition is essential for efficiency, innovation, and fair pricing. Monopolies can hinder these aspects by eliminating competition and stifling innovation. By preventing monopolies from forming or breaking them up when they emerge, governments can ensure that markets remain competitive and consumers have access to a variety of options, keeping prices in check and promoting healthy competition.
