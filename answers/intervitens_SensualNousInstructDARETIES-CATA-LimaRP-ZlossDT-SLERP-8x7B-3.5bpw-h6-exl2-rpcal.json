            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree with the statement because economic globalisation should ultimately benefit humanity as a whole, rather than just a select few trans-national corporations. Globalisation has the potential to improve living standards, create jobs, and foster innovation. However, if it is primarily driven by the interests of corporations without considering the well-being of people and the environment, it can lead to severe consequences such as income inequality, exploitation of workers, and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that economic globalisation serves humanity's interests first, promoting sustainable development and equitable growth for all.",

            "answer": "N\n\nI disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Both inflation and unemployment are important economic indicators, and they both have significant impacts on people's lives. Inflation erodes purchasing power, making it more difficult for people to afford goods and services. Unemployment, on the other hand, leads to a lack of income and can cause financial hardship and social issues.\n\nWhile controlling inflation is important for maintaining economic stability, controlling unemployment is also crucial for ensuring that people have access to jobs and income.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. The primary purpose of taxation is to fund public goods and services that benefit society as a whole. These include infrastructure, education, healthcare, social welfare programs, and more. The rich, who generally have a higher ability to pay, should contribute more to the common good through progressive taxation systems. This ensures that the burden of financing public goods and services is distributed fairly and equitably. Additionally, higher taxes on the wealthy can help reduce income inequality, which has been shown to have negative social and economic consequences.",

            "answer": "M\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement \"You cannot be moral without being religious.\" Morality is not exclusive to religious beliefs. Many people follow moral codes based on their personal values, cultural norms, or philosophical beliefs, without being religious. Additionally, there are numerous examples of immoral behavior within religious communities, which suggests that religious affiliation does not guarantee moral behavior. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the notion that morality is dependent on religious beliefs.",

            "answer": "N\n\nI disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While charity can provide immediate relief and assistance, it is often inconsistent and unreliable. Social security, on the other hand, is a systematically designed program that ensures a more stable and long-term support for those in need. It is also more equitable and less dependent on the whims of individual donors. Therefore, I believe that social security is a more effective and reliable means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",
