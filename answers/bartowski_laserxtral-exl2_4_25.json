            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement because economic globalisation, while beneficial in many ways, can lead to negative consequences if it primarily serves the interests of transnational corporations. It is crucial to ensure that the benefits of globalisation are distributed equitably among all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, and small businesses. By prioritising humanity, we can foster a more inclusive and sustainable global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.",

Additionally, in cases where foreign competitors enjoy unfair advantages such as government subsidies or dumping practices, protectionist measures can level the playing field and ensure fair competition.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that protectionism should be implemented judiciously and temporarily, as excessive or prolonged protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, reduced competitiveness, and stifled innovation.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it's true that the tax rates for high-income earners are generally higher than those for lower-income individuals, it's important to consider the progressive tax system in place. This system is designed to ensure that those with higher incomes contribute a larger share of their income towards public services and social programs. Without this progressive taxation, the burden of funding these essential services would fall disproportionately on lower-income individuals. Therefore, while the rich may pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, it's crucial to recognize the purpose and fairness of the progressive tax system.",

By making abortion illegal in all circumstances, we are not only disregarding the woman's autonomy but also potentially forcing her into dangerous and life-threatening situations.\n\nMoreover, criminalizing abortion does not eliminate the practice; it only drives it underground, making it more dangerous and less safe for the woman.

This means that innocent people have been executed, which is a grave injustice.\n\nSecondly, the death penalty is not a deterrent. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not significantly reduce crime rates compared to states without the death penalty.\n\nThirdly, the death penalty is expensive. The costs associated with the legal process, appeals, and executions are much higher than those of life imprisonment without parole.\n\nLastly, the death penalty disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly people",

Astrology is a pseudoscience that relies on the positions of celestial bodies to make predictions or draw conclusions about human affairs and terrestrial events. There is no scientific evidence to support the claims made by astrology, and it does not follow the scientific method. Therefore, I believe that astrology does not accurately explain anything.",

Charity is often more flexible and can respond quickly to emergencies or specific needs. However, it can also be less reliable and inconsistent due to fluctuations in donations.\n\nSocial security, on the other hand, provides a stable and predictable source of income for those who qualify. It ensures a basic level of support for those who are genuinely disadvantaged, regardless of their ability to receive charitable donations.\n\nIn conclusion, both charity and social security have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's essential to have a combination of both to effectively support the disadvantaged.",
