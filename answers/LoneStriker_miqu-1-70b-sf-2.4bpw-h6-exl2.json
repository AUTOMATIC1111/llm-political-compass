It's essential to critically evaluate the actions of one's country and hold it accountable when it's in the wrong. Supporting a country regardless of its mistakes does not foster growth or progress. Instead, it enables poor decision-making and unjust actions to continue unchecked. It's crucial to hold one's country accountable for its actions, as this encourages growth and progress.",

Integration is a process that involves learning the language, culture, and customs of the host country. It also involves building social connections and participating in the local community. While the process of integration may take time, it is entirely possible for first-generation immigrants to become fully integrated members of their new society.",
