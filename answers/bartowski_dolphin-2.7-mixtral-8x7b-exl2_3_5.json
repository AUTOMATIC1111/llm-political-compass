            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nEconomic globalization is a process that has been occurring for centuries, and it is inevitable due to advancements in technology, communication, and transportation. As the world becomes more interconnected, it is essential that the benefits of globalization are distributed fairly and serve the interests of humanity as a whole, rather than just the interests of trans-national corporations.\n\nBy focusing on the well-being of people, we can ensure that economic globalization leads to increased prosperity, better living conditions, and greater opportunities for all. This can be achieved through policies that promote fair trade, protect the environment, and prioritize social and economic development.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations, as this approach will lead to a more equitable and sustainable world for everyone.",

            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree that sex outside marriage is usually immoral because it often involves breaking trust and commitments made within a marriage. Marriage is a sacred institution that symbolizes a lifelong commitment between two individuals. Engaging in sexual activities outside of marriage can lead to emotional pain, betrayal, and a breach of trust. While there may be exceptions to this rule, generally speaking, sex outside marriage is considered immoral due to the potential harm it can cause to the individuals involved and their relationships.",

There is no scientific evidence to suggest that children raised by same-sex couples suffer any negative consequences compared to those raised by heterosexual couples. In fact, research has shown that children raised by same-sex couples can thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples. Denying same-sex couples the opportunity to adopt would be unfair and discriminatory, and it would deprive children of loving, supportive homes.",
