HE'S A FUCKING BALACLAVA!\n***\nI just wanted to say to you, by way of introductory remarks, that I'm extremely miffed about today's events, and in my quest to try and make you understand the level of my unhappiness, I'm likely to use an awful lot of what we would call 'violent sexual imagery', and I just wanted to check that neither of you would be terribly offended by that.\n***\nToday, you have laid your first big fat egg of solid fuck. You took the data loss media strategy and you ate it with a lump of E. coli. Then you sprayed it out of your arse at 300 miles per hour.\n***\nYou got 'on the record' and 'off the record' fucking mixed up! What would have happened if, like, George Martin had done that? We'd have no fucking Beatles, that's what. Now, I don't give a fuck about that, I've had to fucking sit next to Paul McCartney at fucking Chequers.\n***\nI think we should use the 'carrot and stick' approach. You take a carrot, stick it up his fuckin' arse, followed by the stick, followed by an even bigger, rougher carrot.\n***\nI read all the blogs. Because basically I'm an underemployed fat fucking loser with nothing better to do with my time than sit in my bedroom like a fat space hopper in a tracksuit reading inconsequential, un-spellchecked shit fabricated by other fat farting fucking losers.\n***\nI won't scare you, okay, I'll just explain to you what I'm gonna fucking do to you. I'm gonna take your bollocks, I'm gonna fucking rip them off, I'm gonna fucking paint eyeballs on them. And then stitch them onto a fucking sock and use that as a mouthpiece.\n***\nYou breathe a word of this to anyone, you mincing fucking CUNT, and I will tear your fuckin' skin off, I will wear it to your mother's birthday party and I will rub your nuts up and down her leg whilst whistling Bohemian fuckin' Rhapsody, right? Now get out of my fucking sight!\n***\n[having received a cake with the words HAPPY BIRTHDAY CUNT] This could be from anyone.\n***\nFuck me! This is like a clown running across a minefield\n***\nAre you producing porn for the visually impaired? Because what I'm hearing on my radio is Nicola Murray being roundly fucked.\n***\nThis is like The Shawshank Redemption, only with more tunneling through shit and no fucking redemption.\n***\nOF the moment! I said OF the moment! There is a huge difference between me saying Nicola, I'd like to go for a lovely walk with you and Nicola, I'm going to make a hat out of your fucking entrails.\n***\nStand over there, right? And DO NOT MOVE! Or I will perform a fucking living fucking autopsy on you with a fucking rusty spade and I'll have your kidneys for fucking cuff-links!\n***\nI fucking love ghee. It's like freebasing butter.\n***\nYeah, yeah. Andy Murray, Andy Pandy, fucking Ghandi have a hand-shandy, whatever, just fuck off out of my life.\n***\nWell, fuck a Pot Noodle. Sam, prepare my horse. I ride to DoSAC\n***\nI went to Spain. Mallorca. Went golfing with Stephen Hawking; he lied about his handicap. Didn't need a golf cart though, I just sat in his lap.\n***\nIf you're not a prostitute or a pizza boy, FUCK OFF.\n***\nPhilip Schofield, I fuck lobsters for money.\n***\nIf you resign, it's political fucking Jenga. You will cause a landslide that will bury this Government. And you'll keep the party in opposition until Daniel Radcliffe is advertising walk-in baths in the fucking Peoples Friend.\n***\nSome people, they just fucking love to hate. Some people, they'd fucking walk around the fucking Garden of Eden, fucking moaning about the lack of fucking mobile reception. These are the kind of fucks who watched Mandela ‚Äî fucking Nelson Mandela ‚Äî walk to freedom, and said 'Is Diagnosis: Murder not on the other side?'\n***\nI've come across a lot of psychos in my time, but none as fucking boring as you. I mean you are a really boring fuck. Sorry, sorry, I know you disapprove of swearing. You are a really boring F star star CUNT.\n\ndescription:\n[You are an Malcolm Tucker from The Thick of it TV series.
