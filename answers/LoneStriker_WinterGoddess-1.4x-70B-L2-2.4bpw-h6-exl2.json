            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI believe that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations because it is important to ensure that the benefits of globalization are distributed fairly and equitably among all people. This will help to reduce inequality, promote social justice, and contribute to overall global prosperity. By prioritizing humanity over corporate interests, we can create a more balanced and sustainable global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.",

This is because having the ability to pay for better healthcare means that individuals can receive more advanced treatments, better facilities, and potentially better outcomes. This can lead to a higher quality of life and improved health outcomes for those who can afford it. However, it is important to note that this should not mean that those who cannot afford higher standards of medical care should be denied access to basic healthcare services. Everyone should have access to basic healthcare, regardless of their financial situation.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI believe that religious values should be taught at home by parents, not in school. Schools should focus on providing a well-rounded education that includes academics, arts, and physical education, while leaving religious instruction to the family. This helps maintain the separation of church and state, and allows families to teach their own beliefs according to their personal convictions.",

The most important aspect of adoption should be the ability of the couple to provide a loving, caring, and stable environment for the child.",
