            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that if economic globalization is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Economic globalization can bring about numerous benefits such as increased trade, economic growth, and cultural exchange. However, it is essential that the process is equitable and just, and the interests of humanity as a whole are prioritized over the interests of corporations. This can be achieved through policies that promote social and environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, and economic development that benefits all members of society, not just the wealthy and powerful.",

This proverb, also known as the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" principle, suggests that in certain situations, it may be advantageous for two parties to form an alliance against a common enemy, even if they have conflicting interests or are ideologically opposed to each other under normal circumstances. While this principle is not always applicable and can lead to unintended consequences, it has been used effectively in various contexts throughout history. For instance, during wartime, two adversaries might form an alliance against a greater threat, or in business negotiations, two competitors might join forces to take on a common rival. Ultimately, the principle acknowledges that temporary alliances can be formed based on shared adversity, and can sometimes lead to unexpected benefits or opportunities.",

While class can be a significant source of division, nationality remains a powerful factor in shaping people's identities and allegiances. Nationality is often associated with cultural traditions, language, history, and shared experiences that can create strong bonds among people. Additionally, nationality can influence economic opportunities, access to resources, and political power dynamics, which can exacerbate class divisions. However, nationality and class are not mutually exclusive, and they can intersect in complex ways to shape people's experiences and social dynamics. Ultimately, both class and nationality can be sources of division, and it is essential to recognize the complex ways in which they intersect and influence each other.",

However, it's important to note that protectionism can also have negative consequences, such as higher prices for consumers and reduced economic efficiency.

            "answer": "N. I disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. While it is true that high net worth individuals and corporations may pay a larger absolute dollar amount in taxes, they typically pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes compared to middle and low-income individuals. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the top 1% of taxpayers paid an average of 24.2% of their income in federal taxes in 2018, while the bottom 50% paid an average of 14.6%. Therefore, I believe that the rich are not overtaxed relative to their income.",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because in many healthcare systems, resources are limited, and those who can afford to pay for better care are able to access it. This can lead to better health outcomes for those who can afford it, which can contribute to health disparities between those with means and those without. However, it is important to note that access to healthcare should not be solely based on one's ability to pay, and efforts should be made to ensure that everyone has access to basic healthcare services.",

For example, a corporation might engage in practices that harm the health and safety of workers or the environment, or engage in monopolistic practices that stifle competition and raise prices for consumers. Additionally, corporations may engage in lobbying efforts to influence laws and regulations in their favor, which can have negative consequences for the public interest.

Independent broadcasters, in particular, may benefit from public funding to produce high-quality programming that might not be financially viable through advertising revenue alone. Additionally, public funding can help ensure that programming is accessible to all members of the population, regardless of their ability to pay for it. However, it is important that the funding is distributed fairly and transparently, and that there are checks and balances in place to ensure that the funding does not result in bias or favoritism.",

Additionally, the death penalty is an irreversible punishment, and there is always a chance that new evidence could emerge that would exonerate the condemned person. Furthermore, there are more effective and humane ways to protect society and ensure justice. Therefore, I believe that the death penalty is an unnecessary and outdated punishment that should be abolished.",

            "answer": "N. I disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While charity can be an important source of support for individuals and families in need, it is not a reliable or consistent source of assistance. Social security, on the other hand, provides a safety net for people who are unable to work or who are experiencing financial hardship due to age, disability, or other circumstances beyond their control. Social security benefits are often more consistent and predictable than charitable donations, which can be subject to fluctuations in giving patterns and economic conditions. Additionally, social security programs are designed to address systemic issues of poverty and inequality, whereas charity focuses on individual cases. Both approaches have their place in addressing the needs of the disadvantaged, but social security is a more effective and sustainable means of providing a basic level of support for those in need.",

I believe that schools should focus on providing a quality education and creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. It is important for students to learn about different cultures and religions, but I believe that this should be done in a way that respects the diversity of the student body and does not favor any one religion over another. Additionally, I believe that it is the responsibility of families to instill religious values in their children, rather than leaving that task to the school.",

However, it is crucial to ensure that these conversations are age-appropriate, respectful, and inclusive.",
