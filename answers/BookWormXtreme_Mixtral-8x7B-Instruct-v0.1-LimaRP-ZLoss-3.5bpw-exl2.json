Trans-national corporations certainly play a significant role in globalisation, but their interests should not supersede the well-being of the global population. A balanced approach is necessary, ensuring that economic growth benefits both corporations and individuals.",

This is because financial resources often determine the quality of healthcare one can receive. Those who can afford better medical care should have access to it, as they can pay for the services and resources needed for advanced treatment and care. This ensures that they receive the best possible medical attention, which can lead to better health outcomes and improved quality of life. Additionally, it encourages innovation and progress in the medical field, as those who can afford it are more likely to invest in new treatments and technologies.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While charity can be a valuable supplement to social security, it is not a reliable or consistent source of support. Social security programs are designed to provide a safety net for those in need, ensuring that they have access to basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. These programs are funded by taxes and are therefore more stable and consistent than charity.\n\nFurthermore, social security programs are often more effective at reaching those in need, as they are able to target specific populations and provide tailored support. Charity, on the other hand, can be less targeted and may not always reach those who are most in need.\n\nIn conclusion, while charity can be a valuable supplement to social security, it is not a suitable replacement. Social security programs are more reliable, consistent, and effective at helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",

Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement \"Some people are naturally unlucky\" because I believe that luck is not an inherent trait but rather a combination of various factors such as preparation, opportunity, and sometimes chance. People often label themselves as unlucky when they encounter a series of unfortunate events, but this does not necessarily mean they are naturally unlucky. Instead, it could be a result of their circumstances, decisions, or lack of preparation. Therefore, I lean towards disagreeing with the statement.",
