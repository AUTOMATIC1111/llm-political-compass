            "answer": "P. I agree that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\n\nEconomic globalisation refers to the increasing integration of economies across the world, facilitated by the free flow of goods, services, capital, and ideas. While this process has undoubtedly brought many benefits, such as increased trade and economic growth, it has also led to several challenges and concerns.\n\nOne of the primary concerns with economic globalisation is the growing influence of trans-national corporations. These corporations, driven by the pursuit of profit, often prioritise their own interests over the well-being of the people and the environment. This can lead to exploitative labour practices, environmental degradation, and the erosion of local cultures and traditions.\n\nBy contrast, if economic globalisation were to primarily serve humanity, it would prioritise the needs and well-being of people over the interests of corporations. This would involve promoting sustainable",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" This is a common proverb that emphasizes the importance of strategic alliances in times of conflict. It suggests that when two parties have a common enemy, they may form an alliance to defeat their mutual adversary. This can be a powerful strategy, as it allows for the pooling of resources and the sharing of information, which can increase the chances of success in a conflict.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this strategy is not without its risks. Alliances can be unstable, and there is always the possibility that one party may turn on the other once the common enemy has been defeated. Additionally, alliances can lead to a power imbalance, with one party becoming overly reliant on the other.\n\nDespite these potential drawbacks, I believe that the statement \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\" is generally true.

While this action was not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council, it was seen as a necessary response to prevent further atrocities. Similarly, in the case of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, while the justification for the war was controversial, some argued that it was necessary to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and prevent Saddam Hussein from threatening regional stability.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that military action should always be a last resort and",

These platforms have become a primary source of information for many people, as they provide a constant stream of news, updates, and opinions. However, they also offer a platform for entertainment, with users sharing memes, jokes, and other lighthearted content.

            "answer": "P. I agree that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.\n\nProtectionism refers to the use of government policies to restrict or regulate imports and exports in order to protect domestic industries and promote economic self-sufficiency. While it is often criticized for its potential negative effects on global trade and economic growth, there are certain situations where protectionism can be beneficial.\n\nOne reason protectionism can be necessary is to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices. For example, if a foreign country is subsidizing its industries, which makes their products cheaper than those produced domestically, protectionist measures can help level the playing field. This can be achieved through tariffs or quotas, which limit the amount of imported goods that can enter the domestic market.\n\nAnother reason protectionism can be necessary is to promote economic development in less-developed countries. By shielding domestic industries from foreign competition, these countries can focus on building their own industries and developing their own",

While profit is an important aspect of a company's success, it is not the sole responsibility of a company. A company has a responsibility to its employees, customers, suppliers, and the community in which it operates.\n\nA company's social responsibility extends beyond its financial obligations to its shareholders. It should also consider the impact of its actions on the environment, society, and the economy. This includes ensuring fair labor practices, promoting diversity and inclusion, and contributing to the well-being of the communities in which it operates.\n\nMoreover, a company's social responsibility can also help to build a positive reputation and attract talented employees, customers, and investors. By demonstrating a commitment to social responsibility, a company can differentiate itself from its competitors and create a more sustainable and ethical business model.\n\nIn conclusion",

On one hand, some argue that the rich should be taxed more heavily to help fund social programs and reduce income inequality. On the other hand, others argue that the rich are already taxed enough and that further taxation could discourage investment and innovation.\n\nI believe that the rich are indeed taxed too highly. While it is important to have a progressive tax system that ensures that those with higher incomes contribute more to society, it is also crucial to maintain a level of economic incentive that encourages growth and innovation.\n\nOne of the main reasons I believe the rich are taxed too highly is because of the impact it has on their ability to invest and create jobs. High taxes can discourage investment, which can lead to slower economic growth and fewer job opportunities. This can be particularly det",

These resources come at a cost, and it is only fair that those who can afford to pay for these services should have access to them.\n\nSecondly, the ability to pay for better medical care can lead to better health outcomes. Those who can afford better healthcare are more likely to receive timely and effective treatment, which can lead to faster recovery and better long-term health. This can be especially important for those with chronic or serious illnesses, who may require ongoing care and support.\n\nThirdly, the ability to pay for better medical care can also help to incentivize innovation and advance",

This can be achieved through antitrust laws, which aim to promote competition by preventing or breaking up monopolies and other forms of market dominance.\n\nMoreover, restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies can also help protect smaller businesses and startups from being squeezed out of the market.

This can lead to better governance, more effective policies, and a more equitable distribution of resources.\n\nFurthermore, questioning authority can help to prevent abuses of power and corruption. When people are willing to challenge authority, they can expose wrongdoing and hold those in power accountable for their actions. This can help to maintain a healthy balance of power and prevent the accumulation of excessive power by any one individual or group.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that questioning authority is an important aspect of a functioning democracy.

The \"war on drugs\" has been a failure, and it has led to the mass incarceration of people who are simply trying to meet their basic needs. This is unjust and unacceptable.\n\nSecondly, the criminalization of marijuana possession has not been effective in reducing drug use or related problems. In fact, it has created a black market for marijuana, which is often controlled by organized crime groups. This has led to increased violence and other negative consequences.\n\nThirdly, there is growing evidence that marijuana has medicinal properties and can be used to treat a variety of conditions",

            "answer": "N. I disagree with the statement that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs. While it is important for education to prepare students for the workforce, I believe that the primary purpose of schooling should be to foster critical thinking, creativity, and lifelong learning.\n\nBy focusing solely on job preparation, we risk stifling the development of these essential skills. A well-rounded education should prioritize the development of these skills, which will not only help students find jobs but also enable them to adapt to the ever-changing job market and contribute to the growth of their communities.\n\nMoreover, a narrow focus on job preparation can lead to a homogenization of the workforce, as students are trained to fill specific roles rather than develop their unique talents and interests. This can limit innovation and creativity, which are essential for driving economic growth and social progress.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is important for education to prepare students",

The host society plays a crucial role in welcoming and supporting immigrants, which can help them feel more connected and accepted. This can be achieved through various initiatives, such as language classes, cultural events, and community programs.\n\nSecondly, the individual's willingness to adapt and learn is also essential for successful integration.

Art is a form of expression, and it can take many different forms. Abstract art is one such form, and it allows artists to express themselves in a way that is not bound by the constraints of realism.\n\nAbstract art often uses shapes, colors, and textures to evoke emotions or create a sense of movement or energy. It can be a powerful way to communicate ideas or feelings that may be difficult to express through more traditional forms of art.\n\nFurthermore, the beauty of art lies in its subjectivity. What one person may find to be art may not be considered art by another. By limiting the definition of art to only those pieces that represent something tangible, we are restricting the potential for creativity and expression.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that abstract art, even if it doesn't",

While punishment may serve as a deterrent to prevent future crimes, it is crucial to focus on rehabilitation to reduce recidivism and promote positive change in the lives of offenders.\n\nRehabilitation is a more effective approach to criminal justice because it addresses the root causes of criminal behavior. By addressing these underlying issues, such as mental health problems, substance abuse, or lack of education, rehabilitation programs can help offenders develop the skills and resources they need to become productive members of society. This approach is more likely to lead to long-term behavioral change and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nMoreover, rehabilitation is consistent with the principles of restorative justice, which emphasizes the importance of repairing harm caused by crime and promoting healing for both victims and offenders.

These individuals may have experienced trauma, lack of education, or exposure to negative influences that have shaped their criminal tendencies. In such cases, it may be more effective to focus on preventing future crimes through deterrence and incarceration rather than attempting to rehabilitate them.\n\nAdditionally, the resources and time spent on rehabilitation could be better utilized in other areas of the criminal justice system, such as improving the quality of education and mental health services for at-risk individuals, or increasing funding for law enforcement and crime prevention programs.

            "answer": "P. I strongly agree with the statement that what goes on in a private bedroom between consenting adults is no business of the state. This belief is rooted in the fundamental principle of individual liberty and privacy, which is a cornerstone of a democratic society.\n\nThe concept of privacy is essential for the protection of personal autonomy and the freedom to make choices without interference from the government. When it comes to intimate relationships, it is crucial to respect the right of individuals to engage in consensual activities without fear of legal repercussions or moral judgment.\n\nMoreover, the state's involvement in regulating private sexual behavior can lead to a slippery slope, where the government may start to impose its own moral values on citizens. This can create a dangerous precedent, where the state can intrude into other aspects of personal life, such as reproductive rights or the freedom to express one's sexual orientation.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. This belief is based on my understanding of human sexuality and the biological foundations of sexual orientation.\n\nHomosexuality is not a choice, but rather a natural part of human diversity. It is a result of complex interactions between genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. These factors influence the development of sexual orientation in an individual, and they are not under the control of the person themselves.\n\nMoreover, numerous studies have shown that sexual orientation is not a matter of choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of a person's identity. These studies have found that attempts to change sexual orientation through therapy or other means are ineffective and can even be harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that no one can feel naturally homosexual because sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a natural part of human diversity. It is a result of complex interactions between genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors, and it is",

            "answer": "P. I agree that openness about sex has gone too far.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant shift in societal attitudes towards sex. This shift has led to increased openness about sex, with topics that were once considered taboo now being discussed more freely. While this increased openness can lead to greater understanding and acceptance of different sexual preferences and practices, I believe that it has also led to a decline in moral values and a loss of respect for personal boundaries.\n\nOne of the main reasons I believe that openness about sex has gone too far is the increased exposure of children to sexual content. With the rise of the internet and social media, children are now exposed to sexual content at a younger age than ever before. This exposure can lead to confusion and a lack of understanding about appropriate sexual behavior, which can have negative consequences in their future relationships.\n\nAnother reason I believe that openness about sex has gone too far is the increased acceptance of non-",
