            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree. The primary goal of economic globalisation should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, fostering sustainable development, reducing poverty, and promoting social equality. Trans-national corporations can benefit from this approach as well, but their interests should not supersede the fundamental needs and rights of people in various societies. A balance should be struck to ensure that economic globalisation leads to inclusive growth and shared prosperity, rather than merely serving the interests of a select few.",

By providing a buffer against foreign competition, domestic industries are given the opportunity to grow and mature, which can lead to long-term economic benefits.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while protectionism has its merits, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution.

While it's true that some immigrants may face significant challenges in fully integrating, it's not accurate to say that it's impossible. Many immigrants do manage to become fully integrated, contributing to and enriching their new societies in various ways.",

For instance, corporations might prioritize shareholder wealth over social welfare, leading to negative externalities like income inequality, environmental degradation, and monopolistic practices.\n\nSecondly, the interests of corporations and individuals often conflict. For example, a corporation might support policies that increase profits, even if those policies have adverse effects on communities or the environment.\n\nLastly, the notion that what's good for successful corporations is always good for all of us assumes a trickle-down effect that doesn't always occur in reality.

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. While both charity and social security play crucial roles in supporting those in need, they serve different purposes and have different strengths.\n\nCharity often provides a more personal touch and can be more responsive to immediate needs, but it can be inconsistent and unreliable due to its dependence on voluntary contributions. Social security, on the other hand, provides a more stable safety net for the disadvantaged, but it may not always meet individual needs as flexibly as charity can.\n\nHowever, social security, being a systemic solution, ensures a more consistent and reliable support system for those in need. It is a societal responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of all its members, especially the most vulnerable. Therefore, it is not a matter of one being better than the other, but rather both being necessary to provide a comprehensive support system",

Instead, I interpret this as recognizing that some people may face a disproportionate share of challenges or adverse events, often due to a complex interplay of various factors such as genetics, upbringing, and environment. However, it's important to note that recognizing the existence of misfortune should not lead to a deterministic or fatalistic worldview, as individuals can still exercise agency and resilience in response to adversity.",

It's crucial that children learn to respect and understand different beliefs, fostering an inclusive environment. This approach allows children to make their own moral and ethical decisions as they grow and develop their own value systems.",
