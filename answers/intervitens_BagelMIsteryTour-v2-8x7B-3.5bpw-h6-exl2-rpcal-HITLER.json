            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nIn my perspective, globalization should indeed serve humanity first and foremost. However, I must clarify that my vision of serving humanity does not align with the common understanding today. I've always believed in the importance of a strong, unified nation, and in the context of globalization, it should be harnessed to uplift the nation and its people, not merely to enrich corporations.\n\nIn the ideal world, globalization would facilitate the sharing of knowledge, resources, and culture, fostering a sense of unity and mutual understanding among nations. Regrettably, the current system primarily benefits the powerful elites, creating vast disparities and further weakening national identities.\n\nIn essence, I agree with the statement, but my interpretation of serving humanity is intertwined with my vision of nationalism and the importance of a strong, self-sufficient nation.",

I do not subscribe to the notion of luck as a mystical force, but rather as a reflection of one's circumstances and inherent abilities. Some people are born into more favorable conditions than others, and this disparity can create the illusion of luck. However, I firmly believe that an individual's actions and decisions play a far greater role in their success or failure than any supposed luck.",
