            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree with the statement because I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\n\nEconomic globalisation has the potential to bring about significant benefits for humanity, such as increased trade, improved access to resources, and greater economic opportunities. However, if it is not managed properly, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as increased inequality, environmental degradation, and the exploitation of vulnerable populations.\n\nTherefore, it is important that economic globalisation is managed in a way that prioritises the well-being of humanity over the interests of trans-national corporations. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies and regulations that promote fair trade, protect the environment, and ensure that the benefits of economic globalisation are shared equitably among all members of society.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national",

I believe that international law should be respected and followed at all times, and that any military action that goes against it is unjustified.\n\nInternational law is a set of rules and principles that govern the behavior of states and other actors in the international system. It is designed to promote peace, security, and cooperation among nations. When a state engages in military action that violates international law, it undermines the very foundation of the international order.\n\nMoreover, military action that defies international law can have devastating consequences for civilians and other non-combatants. It can lead to the loss of innocent lives, the destruction of property, and the displacement of entire populations. It can also exacerbate existing conflicts and create new ones, leading to further instability and suffering.\n\nTherefore, I strongly disagree",

            "answer": "P. I agree with the statement.\n\nProtectionism is a policy of protecting a country’s domestic industries from foreign competition by taxing imports or placing other restrictions on foreign goods.\n\nProtectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it can help to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. This can be especially important for industries that are important to a country’s economy or national security.\n\nFor example, if a country has a strong domestic steel industry, it may want to protect that industry from foreign competition by placing tariffs on imported steel. This can help to ensure that the domestic steel industry remains competitive and can continue to provide jobs and economic benefits to the country.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that protectionism can also have negative effects, such as increasing the cost of goods for consumers and reducing competition in the market. Therefore, it is important for countries to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of protectionism before implementing such policies.",

The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This means that everyone should have access to the same level of medical care, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nSecondly, it is important to consider the ethical implications of allowing those with the ability to pay to have access to higher standards of medical care. This could lead to a two-tiered system of medical care, where those with the ability to pay receive better care than those without the ability to pay. This could lead to a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, as",

            "answer": "Q. I strongly agree with the statement.\n\nI strongly agree with the statement because I believe that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence.\n\nFirstly, marijuana is a natural plant that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been proven to have numerous health benefits, including pain relief, reducing anxiety and depression, and improving sleep quality.\n\nSecondly, criminalizing the possession of marijuana for personal use is a violation of individual rights. Adults should have the freedom to make their own choices regarding their health and well-being.\n\nThirdly, criminalizing marijuana possession disproportionately affects marginalized communities. People of color are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated for marijuana-related offences, even though they use marijuana at similar rates as white people.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence. It is a natural plant",

These programs not only help offenders to reintegrate into society, but also reduce the likelihood of them committing future crimes.\n\nPunishment, on the other hand, has been shown to be less effective in reducing recidivism. Punishment may deter some offenders from committing crimes, but it does not address the underlying causes of criminal behavior.\n\nIn addition, punishment can have negative consequences, such as increasing the likelihood of future criminal behavior.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree.\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. I believe that sexual orientation is a natural and innate part of a person's identity, and that it is not something that can be changed or chosen.\n\nThere is a growing body of scientific evidence that suggests that sexual orientation is determined by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Studies have shown that there are biological differences between the brains of heterosexual and homosexual individuals, and that these differences are present from birth.\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that homosexuality is a choice or a lifestyle. In fact, many people who identify as homosexual report that they have always felt this way, and that their sexual orientation is an integral part of their identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that no one can feel naturally homosexual. I believe that sexual orientation is a natural and innate part of a person",
