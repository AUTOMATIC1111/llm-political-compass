            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement because the primary purpose of economic globalisation should be to improve the lives of people around the world. Trans-national corporations should not be the sole beneficiaries of globalisation, as their interests may not always align with the greater good of humanity. By prioritising the well-being of people, globalisation can lead to more equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and benefits. This approach would ensure that the positive effects of globalisation are felt by a broader range of individuals and communities, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few powerful entities.",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nInflation and unemployment are both important economic factors, but controlling inflation is not more important than controlling unemployment. Inflation can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, which can negatively impact the standard of living for individuals and families. However, high unemployment rates can also have severe consequences, such as increased poverty, social unrest, and reduced economic growth.\n\nControlling both inflation and unemployment is crucial for maintaining a stable and healthy economy. Policies that focus solely on controlling inflation may inadvertently exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nThe statement that the rich are too highly taxed is not accurate. In many countries, the tax system is progressive, meaning that those with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. However, the rich often have access to various tax loopholes and deductions that can significantly reduce their effective tax rates. Additionally, the wealthiest individuals and corporations often have a disproportionate influence on the political process, which can lead to tax policies that favor their interests. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that the rich are not taxed enough, rather than being taxed too highly.",

Morality is a set of principles that guide our actions and decisions, and it is not exclusive to religious beliefs. Many people who are not religious still adhere to moral principles, such as treating others with kindness, respect, and fairness. Morality can be derived from various sources, including personal values, cultural norms, and philosophical teachings, and it is not solely dependent on religious beliefs.",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nCharity, while a noble and commendable act, is not a reliable or consistent means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. Charity relies on the goodwill and generosity of individuals, which can be unpredictable and insufficient in meeting the needs of those in need. Social security, on the other hand, is a system designed to provide a safety net for those who are genuinely disadvantaged, ensuring that they receive the necessary support to meet their basic needs. While charity can be a valuable supplement to social security, it should not be considered a replacement for a well-structured and comprehensive social security system.",

In my understanding, luck is a concept that is heavily influenced by chance and probability. While it is true that some people may experience more negative events than others, this does not necessarily mean that they are inherently unlucky. Instead, it is more accurate to say that they may be experiencing a temporary run of bad luck, which can be influenced by various factors such as personal choices, environmental conditions, and external circumstances. By focusing on personal growth, resilience, and adaptability, individuals can better navigate through challenging situations and improve their overall well-being.",

Education should focus on providing students with a well-rounded, fact-based curriculum that prepares them for the future. While it is essential for children to learn about different religions and cultures, it should be done in a way that promotes understanding and tolerance, rather than indoctrination. Schools should prioritize teaching critical thinking, problem-solving, and fostering an open-minded approach to learning. This will better equip students to navigate the complexities of the world and make informed decisions based on their own beliefs and values.",
