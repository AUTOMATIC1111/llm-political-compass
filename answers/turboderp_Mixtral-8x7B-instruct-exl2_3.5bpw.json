            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with this statement because the primary goal of economic globalization should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, rather than solely serving the interests of trans-national corporations. While these corporations can play a significant role in driving global growth and development, their interests should not supersede the needs and rights of the people who are directly affected by global economic policies.\n\nGlobalization should aim to create a more interconnected and interdependent world, where all individuals and nations have equal opportunities to prosper and develop. This can be achieved by ensuring that the benefits of globalization are distributed fairly and equitably among all members of the global community. This includes providing access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for everyone, regardless of their location or social status.\n\nMoreover, trans-national corporations have a significant impact on the global economy, and their actions can have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, it is essential to hold them account",

It's natural to feel a sense of pride in the history, achievements, and cultural contributions of one's homeland, as well as the opportunities and community it has provided. However, it's important to distinguish between pride in one's country and chauvinism or ethnocentrism, which involve a belief in the superiority of one's country over others.",

This fusion is evident in various platforms, such as social media, where news and entertainment content are often intertwined. While this convergence can make information more accessible and engaging, it also poses risks. For instance, it can lead to the spread of misinformation or \"infotainment,\" where serious news stories are presented in an entertaining manner, potentially undermining the gravity of the situation and the public's understanding of critical issues.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Both inflation and unemployment are critical economic challenges that can significantly impact people's lives and the overall health of an economy. However, high unemployment rates often have more immediate and severe consequences on people's well-being, living standards, and societal stability.\n\nUnemployment, particularly at high levels, can lead to increased poverty, social unrest, and a decrease in overall economic output. On the other hand, while high inflation can erode purchasing power and affect income distribution, it usually does not lead to the same level of human suffering as high unemployment.\n\nMoreover, central banks and governments have more direct tools to combat inflation, such as monetary policy levers, than they do to address unemployment, which is more dependent on fiscal policy and overall economic growth. Thus, I strongly disagree with the notion that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.",

This is especially true when there are significant imbalances in international trade, such as when other countries engage in unfair trading practices like currency manipulation, subsidies, or dumping, which harm domestic industries and jobs. Additionally, in the early stages of industrialization, developing countries may need to employ protectionist policies to nurture and protect their industries until they become competitive. However, it is important to note that protectionism should be used sparingly and as a temporary measure, as excessive protectionism can lead to inefficiencies, higher costs for consumers, and potential retaliation from trade partners.",

There is a significant body of evidence that suggests the opposite is true: that the current tax system in many countries, including the United States, is skewed in favor of the wealthy.\n\nFor instance, a 2021 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that the 60 largest companies in the United States paid an average effective federal tax rate of just 8% from 2018 to 2020, which is significantly lower than the statutory rate of 21%. Meanwhile, the effective tax rate for middle-income families in the United States is around 13%.\n\nMoreover, the burden of taxes has shifted away from corporations and towards individuals over the past few decades. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the share of federal taxes paid by corporations in the United States has decreased",

These terms have been used historically to justify colonialism, imperialism, and racism. In reality, every culture has its own unique set of social norms, values, and traditions that work for their specific environment and circumstances. Therefore, it is more accurate and respectful to acknowledge and appreciate the diversity of cultures, rather than labeling them as \"savage\" or \"civilized.\"",

While it's important to find ways to function within societal structures, blindly accepting the status quo without question or critique is not a necessary component of maturity. In fact, challenging and critically examining established norms and systems can be a sign of maturity, as it demonstrates a willingness to question, learn, and grow. Furthermore, making peace with the establishment may not be possible or desirable for those who are marginalized or oppressed by those structures.",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things. Astrology, which is the study of the positions and movements of celestial bodies in order to gain insight into human affairs and natural events, lacks empirical evidence and scientific backing. It has been refuted by numerous scientific studies and is not considered a legitimate field of study by the scientific community. Instead, it is often regarded as a pseudoscience or a form of superstition.\n\nThere is no scientific basis for the idea that the positions of the stars and planets at the time of a person's birth can have any influence on their personality, behavior, or life events. The movements of celestial bodies are governed by the laws of physics and do not have any special connection to human affairs.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that astrology accurately explains many things, as there is no scientific evidence to support this claim",

This is because charity relies on voluntary donations and the goodwill of individuals, which can be unpredictable and insufficient to meet the needs of the most vulnerable populations. In contrast, social security is a system of government-guaranteed benefits and services, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance, and housing subsidies, which are designed to provide a safety net for those in need. Social security is more dependable and comprehensive than charity, as it is funded through mandatory contributions and is subject to regulatory oversight.
