            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with this statement because economic globalization, like any other form of globalization, should ultimately benefit humanity as a whole. It should not primarily serve the interests of trans-national corporations, as this could lead to severe income inequality, exploitation, and an unhealthy concentration of power. Instead, economic globalization should aim to promote global economic development, reduce poverty, and improve overall living standards worldwide. This can be achieved by ensuring fair trade practices, promoting healthy competition, and implementing effective regulations that prevent multinational corporations from abusing their power at the expense of workers, consumers, and the environment.",

While free trade generally promotes economic growth and efficiency, there are instances where protectionist measures might be justified.\n\nFor example, in cases where there is a significant imbalance in trade, where one country is exporting vast amounts more than it is importing, protectionism can help to level the playing field. This can prevent domestic industries from being overwhelmed by foreign competition, thereby preserving jobs and economic stability within the country.\n\nAdditionally, in situations where national security is at stake, protectionism can be crucial. For instance, if a country relies heavily on foreign imports for essential goods such as military equipment or energy resources, protectionist policies can ensure that these needs are met even in times of international conflict or instability.\n\nHowever,",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree.\n\nThe rich are not overtaxed, in fact, they are often undertaxed. The current tax system in many countries, including the United States, favors the wealthy. Wealthy individuals and corporations can take advantage of various tax loopholes and deductions that are not available to the average taxpayer. This allows them to pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes compared to middle and lower-income individuals. Additionally, the argument that high taxes on the rich would hinder economic growth is not supported by evidence. Countries with higher taxes on the wealthy, such as the Scandinavian countries, have strong economies and high standards of living. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that the rich are overtaxed.",

By refusing opportunities to work, they are not only neglecting their responsibilities but also exploiting the resources and assistance provided by society. This can lead to an unfair distribution of resources and create an imbalance in the community. Therefore, it is reasonable for society to expect individuals to take up available opportunities for work and be self-reliant.",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that you cannot be moral without being religious. Morality is a set of principles that governs human behavior, and it can be based on various factors such as societal norms, personal values, and ethical theories. Religion, on the other hand, is a system of beliefs, practices, and rituals related to the divine or supernatural. While some people may find religious teachings to be a source of moral guidance, it is not the only source of morality. Many atheists, agnostics, and people of other or no faith can lead moral lives without adhering to any religious doctrine. In fact, some religious teachings may even contradict widely accepted moral principles, such as promoting discrimination or violence. Therefore, morality and religious belief are not inherently linked.",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nWhile charity is a valuable and necessary part of any society, it is not a suitable replacement for social security. Charity relies on the generosity of individuals and organizations, which can be inconsistent and unreliable. Social security, on the other hand, is a system of government-guaranteed benefits designed to provide a safety net for those in need. It ensures that everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare, regardless of their circumstances. Furthermore, social security can be more effective in reaching those who are truly in need, as it is less susceptible to bias or discrimination compared to charitable giving. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",

In fact, studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do just as well, if not better, than those raised by opposite-sex parents.

Furthermore, the prohibition of pornography can lead to the emergence of an underground market, which can be more harmful and difficult to regulate.
