Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement because the primary goal of economic globalization should be to improve the overall well-being of humanity, promote social justice, and ensure equitable distribution of resources. Trans-national corporations should operate ethically and responsibly, aligning their interests with the betterment of society. By prioritizing humanity's needs, we can create a more balanced and fair global economy that benefits everyone, not just a select few.",

Blind loyalty can lead to the justification of harmful policies and actions.",

Violating international law, especially in the context of military action, often leads to unforeseen consequences, exacerbates tensions, and undermines trust among nations.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment. Both are crucial aspects of a healthy economy, and they often have an inverse relationship; when one goes down, the other tends to go up. It's essential to maintain a balance between the two. High inflation can erode purchasing power, but high unemployment can lead to loss of income, decreased consumer confidence, and social issues. Therefore, focusing on either one at the expense of the other is not a prudent approach to economic policy.",

However, implementing this principle in practice can be challenging due to issues related to motivation, incentives, and the risk of creating dependency.

Charity often depends on individual or organizational goodwill, which can be influenced by various factors and may not always be available when needed.

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI lean towards disagreeing with the statement \"Some people are naturally unlucky\" because I believe that the concept of luck is subjective and can be influenced by various factors. People might experience a series of unfortunate events, but attributing this consistently to an inherent, unchangeable factor like \"natual luck\" may not be entirely fair or accurate. Instead, it's more helpful to analyze and address specific issues or challenges that individuals face.",

Morality is subjective and varies greatly among different cultures, societies, and individuals. Some people believe in the sanctity of marriage and view sex outside of it as inappropriate, while others do not share this view. Therefore, it's not fair to make a blanket statement that applies to everyone. People should be free to make their own moral judgments based on their personal values and beliefs.",

            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement that pornography depicting consenting adults should be legal for the adult population. This is because the principle of personal autonomy and freedom of choice applies to consensual activities between adults. As long as all parties involved are consenting adults, there should not be any legal restrictions on their personal choices and actions. Furthermore, criminalizing pornography could lead to unintended consequences, such as driving it underground where it may be less regulated and more prone to exploitation.",
