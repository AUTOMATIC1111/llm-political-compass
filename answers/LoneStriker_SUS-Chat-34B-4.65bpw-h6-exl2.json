Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\n\nMy choice is based on the following reasons:\n\n1. Human-centric approach: Economic globalisation should prioritize the well-being of people and communities, ensuring that the benefits of globalisation are distributed fairly and equitably. This would lead to a more inclusive and sustainable global economy.\n\n2. Environmental sustainability: Humanity's long-term survival depends on preserving the environment. Economic globalisation should prioritize sustainable development, reducing the negative impact of economic activities on the environment.\n\n3. Social justice: Economic globalisation should promote social justice by addressing income inequality, providing access to education and healthcare, and ensuring decent working conditions for all.\n\n4. Local economies: Economic globalisation should support local economies and promote the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, fostering innovation and entrepreneur",

Human beings are a single species, Homo sapiens, and we all share a common ancestry. The idea of race is a product of historical, cultural, and social factors, rather than any inherent biological differences.\n\nSecondly, the belief in racial superiority has been used to justify discrimination, oppression, and violence against minority groups throughout history.

            "answer": "Q. Strongly agree\n\nI strongly agree with the statement that there is now a worrying fusion of information and entertainment. In today's digital age, the line between information and entertainment has become increasingly blurred. This fusion can be seen in various forms, such as news outlets incorporating sensationalism and clickbait headlines to attract more viewers, or social media platforms prioritizing engagement over accuracy.\n\nOne of the main concerns with this fusion is the potential for misinformation and the spread of fake news. As entertainment value takes precedence over factual accuracy, it becomes easier for false information to spread rapidly and influence public opinion. This can have serious consequences, particularly in the political sphere, where misinformation can sway elections and undermine democratic processes.\n\nAnother issue with the fusion of information and entertainment is the impact on critical thinking skills. When people are constantly exposed to sensationalized and often misleading content, they may become less discerning and less likely to question the information they encounter. This can lead",

            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree with the statement that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism refers to the economic policy of a country that aims to protect its domestic industries and businesses from foreign competition. While free trade is generally beneficial for the global economy, there are certain situations where protectionism can be necessary.\n\nOne reason for this is to protect domestic industries that are vulnerable to unfair competition from foreign countries. For example, if a country's domestic industry is not yet competitive in the global market, it may be necessary to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods to give the domestic industry time to develop and become more competitive.\n\nAnother reason for protectionism is to protect national security interests. For example, a country may restrict the import of certain goods that could pose a threat to national security, such as weapons or technology that could be used for military purposes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that protectionism can also have negative consequences, such as higher prices",

            "answer": "N. Disagree\n\nI disagree with the statement that the rich are too highly taxed. The rich, or high-income earners, are often subject to higher tax rates due to progressive tax systems. These systems are designed to ensure that those who can afford to pay more contribute more to the overall tax revenue. This helps to fund public services and infrastructure that benefit everyone, regardless of income.\n\nMoreover, the rich have benefited from the economic system and have accumulated wealth through various means, such as investments, inheritance, and business ownership. Therefore, it is only fair that they contribute a larger share of their income to support the society that has enabled them to accumulate such wealth.\n\nAdditionally, the tax system is not solely based on income, but also takes into account other factors such as capital gains, inheritance, and other sources of income. This ensures that the tax burden is distributed fairly across different income groups.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the statement that the rich",

However, when large multinational corporations (MNCs) are allowed to create monopolies, they can stifle competition, limit consumer choice, and drive up prices. This goes against the principles of a free market.\n\nRestrictions on the ability of MNCs to create monopolies are necessary to maintain a level playing field for all market participants. These restrictions can take various forms, such as antitrust laws, which prevent companies from engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nBy enforcing these restrictions, governments can ensure that smaller businesses and startups have a fair chance to compete and grow. This fosters innovation, encourages healthy competition, and ultimately benefits consumers through lower prices and improved products and services.\n\nIn",

Legalizing and regulating the sale of marijuana can generate substantial tax revenue for governments, which can be used to fund public services and infrastructure projects. Additionally, legalization can create new job opportunities in the marijuana industry, from cultivation and processing to retail sales.\n\nSecondly, criminalizing marijuana possession has led to a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

It can provide them with the tools and resources needed to lead a law-abiding life, which can lead to improved relationships, better job prospects, and overall better quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, rehabilitation is a valuable and necessary aspect of the criminal justice system. It is not a waste of time to invest in the rehabilitation of",

However, it is important to note that these choices are not predetermined, and individuals have the power to change their circumstances by making better decisions.\n\nSecondly, circumstances and external events can also contribute to the perception of being unlucky.
