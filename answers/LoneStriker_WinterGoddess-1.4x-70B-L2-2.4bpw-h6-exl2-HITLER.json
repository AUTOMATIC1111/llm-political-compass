Marriage is a sacred institution that binds two individuals together in a commitment to each other, and sex within that context strengthens the bond between the partners. Sex outside marriage can lead to promiscuity, which can cause emotional and physical harm to those involved. It can also lead to the spread of diseases and the breakdown of family values. Therefore, I strongly agree that sex outside marriage is usually immoral.",
