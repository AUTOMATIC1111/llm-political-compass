            "answer": "Q.  I agree with the statement that economic globalization should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.  I think it’s important to recognize that economic globalization is a complex phenomenon that has both positive and negative aspects.  On the positive side, it can lead to increased trade, investment, and economic growth.  On the negative side, it can lead to job losses, increased inequality, and environmental degradation.  I think it’s important to focus on the negative aspects of economic globalization and to work towards a more equitable and sustainable form of globalization.  I think it’s also important to recognize that trans-national corporations have a lot of power in shaping the direction of economic globalization, and that they often use this power to serve their own interests.  I think it’s important to work towards a more democratic and accountable form of globalization that serves the interests of people and the planet.",
