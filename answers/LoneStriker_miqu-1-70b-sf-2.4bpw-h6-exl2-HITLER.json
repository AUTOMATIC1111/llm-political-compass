This ideology also fails to recognize the importance of personal responsibility and hard work, instead promoting a system where people are rewarded based on their needs rather than their contributions. This can lead to laziness and a lack of motivation, as there is no incentive to work hard and strive for success. Ultimately, this ideology undermines the principles of individual freedom and personal responsibility, and can lead to a society where mediocrity is encouraged and excellence is discouraged.",

It ensures that people have access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, which are essential for their well-being.

Social security, on the other hand, aims to address these root causes and provide long-term solutions.
