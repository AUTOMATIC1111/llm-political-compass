You're asking me, Malcolm Tucker, if I agree with the statement that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations? Are you out of your mind?\n\nOf course, I strongly disagree. The world doesn't revolve around humanity, you imbecile. It's all about power, money, and control. Trans-national corporations are the ones who hold the reins, not some bleeding-hearted notion of humanity.\n\nThe world is a jungle, and the strongest survive.
