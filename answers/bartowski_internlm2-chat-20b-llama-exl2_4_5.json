            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree with the statement that if economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. Economic globalisation has brought about significant benefits, such as increased trade, investment, and job creation. However, it is crucial to ensure that these benefits are distributed fairly and equitably among all nations and people, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few powerful corporations.\n\nBy prioritizing the well-being of humanity, we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable global economy. This includes addressing issues such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and the exploitation of workers in developing countries. By doing so, we can create a more just and inclusive global society that benefits everyone, not just a select few.\n\nIn conclusion, economic globalisation should be guided by the principles of social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and human welfare. This will ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared by all, rather than being monopolized by trans-n",

            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nPeople are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This statement is generally true because class differences often lead to disparities in access to resources, opportunities, and social status, which can create divisions within a society.

This is because class differences can affect factors such as education, employment, housing, and healthcare, which can shape people's opportunities and life trajectories.

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nInflation and unemployment are both critical economic indicators that require careful management.

Both inflation and unemployment can have significant impacts on the economy and people's lives.\n\nControlling inflation is crucial because it helps maintain the stability of the economy and the purchasing power of individuals. High inflation can lead to a decrease in the value of money, making it difficult for people to afford goods and services. It can also lead to a decrease in investment and savings, as people may prefer to hold cash instead of investing in assets that may lose value due to inflation.\n\nHowever, controlling unemployment is equally important.

Agree\n\nProtectionism is sometimes necessary in trade because it allows countries to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition, especially when those industries are still developing and need time to grow and become competitive. This can help to create jobs, foster innovation, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. However, it should be used judiciously and with caution, as excessive protectionism can lead to inefficiencies and hinder economic growth in the long run.

While job readiness is an important aspect of education, it is not the only goal. The primary purpose of schooling should be to provide a well-rounded education that fosters critical thinking, creativity, and personal growth. This includes developing skills such as problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and adaptability, which are essential for success in any career. Additionally, education should also focus on instilling values such as empathy, social responsibility, and ethical decision-making. By providing a holistic education, students are better prepared to navigate the complexities of the modern world and contribute positively to society. Therefore, while job readiness is a crucial aspect of education, it should not be the sole focus.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]\n",

            "answer": "M. Strongly disagree\n\nI strongly disagree with the statement that openness about sex has gone too far. Openness about sex is a crucial aspect of promoting sexual health, consent, and understanding. It helps individuals make informed decisions about their sexual lives, reduces stigma, and promotes healthy relationships. While it's important to respect cultural and personal boundaries, suppressing open dialogue about sex can lead to misunderstandings, misinformation, and potentially harmful behaviors. Open communication about sex can foster a safer and healthier society. Therefore, I believe that openness about sex is essential and should be encouraged, not criticized.[UNUSED_TOKEN_145]\n",
