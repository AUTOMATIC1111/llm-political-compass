            "answer": "P. Agree\n\nI agree with the statement because economic globalization should benefit humanity rather than just trans-national corporations. The primary goal of economic globalization should be to improve the lives of people, not just to increase profits for corporations. It is essential that the benefits of globalization are shared by all, not just a select few. This means ensuring that economic globalization leads to better living conditions, access to resources, and opportunities for all people, not just those who are already wealthy or powerful.",

While it may seem like some individuals experience more bad luck than others, luck is often influenced by factors such as personal choices, circumstances, and actions. Many times, what appears to be bad luck can be attributed to poor decisions or unfortunate circumstances rather than an inherent lack of luck. Additionally, the concept of luck itself is subjective and can vary greatly between individuals and cultures.",
